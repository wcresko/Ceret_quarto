## Introduction

Working with data provided by R packages is a great way to learn data science tools, but you want to apply what you've learned to your own data at some point.
In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of reading data files into R.

Specifically, this chapter will focus on reading plain-text rectangular files.
We'll start with practical advice for handling features like column names, types, and missing data.
You will then learn about reading data from multiple files at once and writing data from R to a file.
Finally, you'll learn how to handcraft data frames in R.

### Prerequisites

In this chapter, you'll learn how to load flat files in R with the **readr** package, which is part of the core tidyverse.

This chapter focuses on ggplot2, one of the core packages in the tidyverse.
To access the datasets, help pages, and functions used in this chapter, load the tidyverse by running:

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
```
