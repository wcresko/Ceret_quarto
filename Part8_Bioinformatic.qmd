# Bioinformatic

This ection of the book contains protocols for basic bioinformatic skills such as using our laboratory cluster 'Genome', as well as our account Nereus on the UO supercomputer Talapas.

Note that there are several appendices that contain greater details and training on things such as the use of command line, R and Python, markdown and literature programming, and documentation using Quarto and Jupyter notebooks.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
