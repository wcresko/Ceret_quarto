:::

-   Bleach, \~6% laundry grade
-   25 ppt Salt Solution
    1.  Combine: 50 g Rock Salt (NaCl) To 2.0 L with tap water
    2.  Stir to dissolve completely.
-   40% Lye (NaOH) solution
    1.  Combine: 200 g Lye (NaOH) To 500 mL with tap water
    2.  Stir to dissolve completely.
    3.  Store in refrigerator (4°C)
-   Buffered Salt Solution
    1.  Combine: 2L, 25 ppt Salt Solution
    2.  125 mL 40% Lye Solution, pre-chilled to 4°C
-   1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate
    1.  Combine: 30 g sodium thiosulfate To 3.0 L with tap water
    2.  Stir to dissolve.
-   Saturated Brine
    1.  Combine: \~25g Rock Salt to 4.0 L with tap water
    2.  Aerate to dissolve.

## Procedure

1.  **Cyst hydration**: Hydrate one full can of dried cyst in 5 L of tap water in a hatching cone with aeration for 1 hour at room temp. Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.

2.  **Filter and rinse cysts**: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.

3.  **Transfer cysts back to the cone**: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.

4.  **De-capsulation**: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.

5.  **Neutralization residual chlorine**: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for \~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.

6.  **Dehydration for long-term storage**: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Hatching and Feeding Brine SOP).
