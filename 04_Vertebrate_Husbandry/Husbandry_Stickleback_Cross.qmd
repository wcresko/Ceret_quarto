## Procedures

### Squeeze Female

::: {.callout-Tip title="Tip"}
Gravid females can be identified by those that have large rounded abdomens and a slightly extended cloaca. If you can see individual eggs in the abdomen this is an indication that the eggs are old. 
:::

1. Cover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female. 
2. If eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready or the eggs are too old. 
3. Remove eggs by slightly squeezing the abdomen starting just posterior of the pectoral girdle towards the cloaca expelling the eggs into a 25mm sterile petri dish. 
4. Note the stock number of the female on the petri dish.

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
The small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs. 
:::

### Dissect Testes From Male

5. Euthanize male by placing him into a small container containing a lethal volume of MS222. 
6. Clean a large, 30cm by 60cm or similar size, glass sheet, fine scissors, and forceps with 95% ethanol. 
7. When male is motionless and not responding in accordance with the Stickleback Adult Euthanasia procedure {#sec-husbandry_stickleback_adult_euthansisa}, remove and the fish and place on the glass sheet. Sever the spinal cord behind skull using a razor to be sure of euthanization. 
8. Use scissors to make incision from the cloaca anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making the incision along the mid line of the fish. 
9. Make another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed. 

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
Incisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface.
:::

10. Locate paired testes and vas deferens. 

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
Testes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects.
:::
 
11. Use fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes. 

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
 Doing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution.
:::

### Storing of Testes

12. If only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4. 
13. Otherwise, place testes into 15 ml tube filled with cold Testes Solution and label tube with make stock number and date. 
14. Store testes at 4°C. 
15. To store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week.

### Prepare Testis

16. If multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male's testes, place both testes on the inside lid of the 25mm petri dish into which a females eggs have been squeezed. 
17. Using a sterile razor to macerate testis. 

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
Under a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a 'sparkling' refraction.
:::

18. Add approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testes prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time, using same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture. Label petri dish(s) with male stock number and time/date of fertilization.

19. Leave sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes. 
20. Add embryo medium to cover the embryos. 
21. Place in incubator at 20°C.

### Separation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr)

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
The animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5 - 2 hr post fertilization. During this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos. 
:::

22. After 2 hours post fertilization, use the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish. 
23. Remove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos. 
24. Rinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium. 
25. Enter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C.

### Raise Embryos (check daily)

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
Embryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time \[see <http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html>\], and hatch at approximately 7-9 days. 48 to 52 hpf stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate. A beating heart can be seen after ~72hr.  
:::

26. Check petri dishes daily and remove embryos that have arrested development. 
27. Change of embryo medium at 3-4 dpf and more if water has fouled.
28. Record health checks on incubator checklist. 

## Place embryos into aquaculture system

29. Prepare small 4.5 L fry tank by adding 400 micron baffle and tuirning in the system water to the tank while letting it flush for 15 minutes. 

::: {.callout-Note title="Note"}
If the plumbing line has set stagnent for awhile flush the line by turning on the valve and expressing system water into a small (not the tank) container.  
:::

30. Once embryos have hatched and thier yolks have absorbed (~9 dpf) add aquaculture system water to dish and let sit 15 minutes. 
31. Gently add the fry to the preppared tank making sure all fry have been added.
