## Materials

-   Fish-safe gloves (e.g., blue nitrile "clean room" gloves)

-   70% ethanol used to disinfect surfaces

-   Germicidal bleach (minimum 5.25% sodium hypochlorite)

-   Sodium thiosulfate crystals

-   Reverse-osmosis filtered water ("RO" water)

-   Reed Mariculture "Rotigrow Plus" rotifer food

-   Reed Mariculture "N-rich" gut-loading food

    ::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
    Not used by zebrafish facility- has a short shelf life
    :::

-   Straining sieves, 20 µm pore size

-   Salinity test pen (e.g., Oakton SaltTestr 11 pocket meter)

    ::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
    Use refractometer for saltwater system. The stickleback facility uses a refractometer for salinity testing
    :::

-   Harvesting pail (e.g., plastic 3-gallon bucket, with graduated lines showing gallons)

-   Sink or wastewater bucket (e.g., plastic 5-gallon bucket)

-   Brackish water mixing bucket (e.g., clean, plastic 5-gallon bucket)

-   Sea salt (e.g., Instant Ocean commercial sea salt mix)

-   Stir stick (e.g., clean, plastic stir rod approximately 18 inches to 24 inches long)

-   Clean 1-Liter beaker for holding harvested rotifers

-   Clean measuring cups (green and blue) or graduated cylinder or calibrated balance to measure sea salt mix

-   Disposable graduated transfer pipettes

**Rotifer Harvest**

1.  Prepare two gallons of 25-27 part-per-thousand (ppt) brackish water (E5).

    1.  Ensure RO water source is clean.
        1.  Use 70% ethanol to disinfect RO water hose end, if using RO hose.
        2.  Use dedicated, clean RO vessels (carboys), if using vessels.
    2.  Add 2 gallons clean RO water to harvesting pail.
        1.  Use 2-gallon graduated mark to ensure volume.
    3.  Add up to 210 grams Instant Ocean to harvesting pail.
        1.  Use graduated beaker to measure Instant Ocean.
        2.  Alternatively, use provided labeled and color-coded tool specific to making 25-27 ppt brackish water.
    4.  Use stir stick to mix and dissolve salt mix into RO water.
    5.  Test the salinity using the refractometer to ensure 25-27 ppt salinity has been achieved.

2.  Harvest rotifers.

    1.  Strain 40% of the rotifer culture through the 20?m sieve.
    2.  Transfer the collected rotifers from the sieve to the pail of 25-27 ppt brackish water: place sieve in brackish water

3.  Concentrate rotifers.

    1.  Pour rotifers through 20µm sieve, fill sieve with brackish water and gently pour into 1 L beaker.
    2.  IMPORTANT - Keep sieve wet at all times.
        1.  Use RO water to loosen rotifers from sieve into beaker, if necessary.

4.  Gut-load the rotifers.

    1.  Add 2 ml "Rotigrow Plus" rotifer food to the beaker and aerate.

    2.  Allow the rotifers to feed for 15 minutes to 1 hour before feeding to the fish.

        ::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
        Adjust down for smaller harvests
        :::

    3.  Test the salinity with the refractometer and adjust using RO water or Instant Ocean sea salt mix as needed to achieve 25-27 ppt.

5.  Use rotifers as food for larval fish.

**Rotifer Water Replacement**

1.  Replace 40% rotifer bucket water using new brackish water.

    1.  Prepare 25-27 ppt brackish water.
        1.  Pour 340 grams (need to recalculate for 5 gallons) Instant Ocean sea salt mix into a clean 5-gallon bucket. Use provided marked and color-coded green tool specific to making replacement water if balance unavailable.
        2.  Fill bucket with RO water.
        3.  Use clean stir stick to mix sea salt mix and RO water completely.
    2.  Pour brackish water into rotifer buckets until full.

**Rotifer Feeding**

1.  Feed rotifers.
    1.  Add 6 ml "Rotigrow Plus" rotifer food to each rotifer bucket.
        1.  Use new graduated transfer pipette to measure and transfer food to rotifers.
        2.  Feed in the morning and again in the afternoon.

**Clean Up**

1.  Sanitize equipment.
    1.  Place sieves into harvesting pail.
    2.  Add two capfuls of 10% bleach.
    3.  Fill harvesting pail with municipal water.
        1.  Ensure all equipment and bucket interior are covered by bleach water.
    4.  Wait 10 minutes.
    5.  Dump harvesting pail bleach water into sink.
    6.  Add 2 tablespoons sodium thiosulfate to harvesting pail.
    7.  Fill harvesting pail with municipal water.
        1.  Ensure all equipment and bucket interior are covered by sodium thiosulfate water.
    8.  Dump harvesting pail water into sink.
    9.  Use 70% ethanol to disinfect exterior of harvesting pail and storage shelf.
    10. Place harvesting pail now containing sanitized equipment on storage cart.
    11. Use Facility rack washer to sanitize wastewater buckets and brackish water mixing buckets then place buckets on storage cart.
