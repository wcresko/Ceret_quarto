## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes best practices for euthanizing embryonic and larval pipefish.
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Bay pipefish, (*Syngnathus leptorhyncus*)
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: 2023

## Materials

-   Euthanasia strength Mesab (see below)
-   Container to hold fish while being euthanized
-   Post mortem fixing equipment
-   Morgue

## Solutions

```         
    Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade. We use tricaine purchased from Pentair, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved. Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl lester also called ethyl m-aminoboenzoate) comes in a powdered form. Purchase the smallest amount possible because tricaine expires quickly

When handling Mesab please wear gloves and wash your hand after use.

-   **Mesab Stock Solution (4g/L, From Zebrafish Book 4th edition) (tris buffered)**:

    -   4 g tricaine powder
    -   979 ml DD water
    -   \~21 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)
    -   Adjust pH to \~7
    -   Aliquot in 50ml tubes, label with MESAB Stock Solution 4g/L, and store in a -20 freezer
    -   This makes 1 liter of solution

-   **Euthanasia Solution (300 mg/L)**:

    -   Make a solution of tris buffered **Stock Solution** as described above. (Or obtain an aliquot from the freezer)
    -   Combine 7.5ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water

## Procedure

1.  Procedure for embryo euthanasia:

    1.  Place embryos into a MS-222 euthanasia solution.
    2.  Leave embryos in solution until movement has stopped, \~ 10 minutes.
    3.  If fish is to be used for experiments, proceed with fixation or preparation for the experiment.
    4.  If the fish are to be disposed of, place embryo in 95% ETOH for 5 minutes and then into morgue for disposal.

This step is necessary as a startle response is not obvious in unhatched fish.
```

2.  Procedure for larval euthanasia:

    1.  Place larva into a MS-222 euthanasia solution.
    2.  Wait 10 minutes and perform a tap test to look for a startle response. If there is a response wait 5 minutes and repeat startle response test. Repeat this step every 5 minutes as needed. If there is no response move to fixing for post mortem experiments or place in morgue.
