## Procedure

::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
Fish only need to be fed once per day on weekends. Ideally, fish will be fed on weekends around noon since they only receive one feeding, but this time can be flexible to accommodate weekend feeders? schedules.
:::

1.  **Conduct health checks** of all fish in Winter Room and Summer Room according to the steps described in "Husbandry_Health_Check_SOP".

2.  Prepare brine cone for feeding by following the steps described in "Husbandry_Hatching_Feeding_BrineShrimp_SOP".

::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
Since fish are only fed once per day on weekends, use the entire brine cone to feed fish.
:::

3.  **Feed Stickleback**

    1.  Winter Room
        -   20g tanks
            1.  Feed 1 scoop of adult stickleback food.
    2.  Summer Room
