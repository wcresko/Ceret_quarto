Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.\nFilter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.\nTransfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.\nDe-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.\nNeutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.\nDehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Hatching and Feeding Brine SOP)."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nTo finish off the programming section, we’re going to give you a quick tour of the most important base R functions that we don’t otherwise discuss in the book. These tools are particularly useful as you do more programming and will help you read code you’ll encounter in the wild.\nThis is a good place to remind you that the tidyverse is not the only way to solve data science problems. We teach the tidyverse in this book because tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, increasing the consistency across functions, and making each new function or package a little easier to learn and use. It’s not possible to use the tidyverse without using base R, so we’ve actually already taught you a lot of base R functions: from library() to load packages, to sum() and mean() for numeric summaries, to the factor, date, and POSIXct data types, and of course all the basic operators like +, -, /, *, |, &, and !. What we haven’t focused on so far is base R workflows, so we will highlight a few of those in this chapter.\nAfter you read this book, you’ll learn other approaches to the same problems using base R, data.table, and other packages. You’ll undoubtedly encounter these other approaches when you start reading R code written by others, particularly if you’re using StackOverflow. It’s 100% okay to write code that uses a mix of approaches, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!\nIn this chapter, we’ll focus on four big topics: subsetting with [, subsetting with [[ and $, the apply family of functions, and for loops. To finish off, we’ll briefly discuss two essential plotting functions.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis package focuses on base R so doesn’t have any real prerequisites, but we’ll load the tidyverse in order to explain some of the differences.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)"

    "section": "Selecting multiple elements with [",
    "text": "Selecting multiple elements with [\n[ is used to extract sub-components from vectors and data frames, and is called like x[i] or x[i, j]. In this section, we’ll introduce you to the power of [, first showing you how you can use it with vectors, then how the same principles extend in a straightforward way to two-dimensional (2d) structures like data frames. We’ll then help you cement that knowledge by showing how various dplyr verbs are special cases of [.\n\nSubsetting vectors\nThere are five main types of things that you can subset a vector with, i.e., that can be the i in x[i]:\n\nA vector of positive integers. Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\")\nx[c(3, 2, 5)]\n\n[1] \"three\" \"two\"   \"five\" \n\n\nBy repeating a position, you can actually make a longer output than input, making the term “subsetting” a bit of a misnomer.\n\nx[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]\n\n[1] \"one\"  \"one\"  \"five\" \"five\" \"five\" \"two\" \n\n\nA vector of negative integers. Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:\n\nx[c(-1, -3, -5)]\n\n[1] \"two\"  \"four\"\n\n\nA logical vector. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a TRUE value. This is most often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.\n\nx &lt;- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)\n\n# All non-missing values of x\nx[!is.na(x)]\n\n[1] 10  3  5  8  1\n\n# All even (or missing!) values of x\nx[x %% 2 == 0]\n\n[1] 10 NA  8 NA\n\n\nUnlike filter(), NA indices will be included in the output as NAs.\nA character vector. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:\n\nx &lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)\nx[c(\"xyz\", \"def\")]\n\nxyz def \n  5   2 \n\n\nAs with subsetting with positive integers, you can use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.\nNothing. The final type of subsetting is nothing, x[], which returns the complete x. This is not useful for subsetting vectors, but as we’ll see shortly, it is useful when subsetting 2d structures like tibbles."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nIn this chapter, we’ve shown you a selection of base R functions useful for subsetting and iteration. Compared to approaches discussed elsewhere in the book, these functions tend to have more of a “vector” flavor than a “data frame” flavor because base R functions tend to take individual vectors, rather than a data frame and some column specification. This often makes life easier for programming and so becomes more important as you write more functions and begin to write your own packages.\nThis chapter concludes the programming section of the book. You’ve made a solid start on your journey to becoming not just a data scientist who uses R, but a data scientist who can program in R. We hope these chapters have sparked your interest in programming and that you’re looking forward to learning more outside of this book."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nPurpose: To help members of the laboratory run the perfect gels - every time.\nProcedure Type: Molecular\nSpecies: N/A\nAuthors\n\nSusan Bassham\n\n\nThe effect of electrophoresis is to separate DNA fragments by size in an agarose matrix and buffer using an electrical current. DNA is negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive pole. Many parameters can affect how the DNA moves through the gel: buffer composition, voltage, length of the gel, percentage of agarose in the gel (in other words, the density of the gel matrix), presence of salt in the DNA, protein bound to DNA, and other factors. Some of these conditions also affect which size ranges of DNA will effectively be “resolved” (i.e., separated enough from one another so you can see them as distinct fragment sizes). “Safeview” is a dye we use in the gel that fluoresces under UV or blue light when bound to DNA, allowing us to see and photograph it when viewed through a special orange filter to cut out the background light. The research goals of using electrophoresis might include:\n\nmeasuring the size of fragments in a DNA sample such as the products of PCR or assessing the intactness of the purified DNA from a tissue extraction\nseparating fragments from one another so that a particular amplicon or size range of DNA can be purified out of the gel for other downstream applications (such as for cloning a PCR fragment for making probes or for Sanger sequencing, or for size selecting a smear of fragments for making a RAD library) while excluding the other fragment sizes\nchecking for the presence or absence of a particular product of PCR as in a screen for orientation of a cloned fragment in a plasmid present in different bacterial colonies, a screen for an insertion in a transgenic animal, a screen to determine the genetic sex or the mitotype of a fish."

    "section": "Common Mistakes",
    "text": "Common Mistakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThese common mistakes will give you a big headache when trying to run gels\n\n\n\nBoiling over the agarose when making a gel.\n\nResult: failure to monitor the agarose when you are trying to dissolve it in the microwave can easily cause it to boil over because powdered substances create a lot of “nodes of nucleation” for bubbles to form. This is especially easy to accidentally do with higher percentages of agarose. It wastes expensive agarose and creates a mess in the microwave. What remains in the bottle will be of an indeterminate percentage/gel stiffness.\n\nNot making sure the tape is adhering well to the mold before casting a gel.\n\nResult: liquid agarose will leak out causing a mess and reagent waste. Make sure the mold is dry beforehand, and use the back edge of a comb, e.g., to run across the tape and make sure it has firm contact.\n\nPositioning the comb teeth too close to one side or to the bottom of the mold when setting up for pouring a gel.\n\nResult: the bottoms (or that side) of wells may be torn when the comb is pulled out, causing the loaded samples to leak out into the buffer during gel loading. Note: even when the comb teeth are not too close to the bottom, low percentage gels are soft and will benefit from having the comb pulled while submerged in the tank - otherwise the suction created by surface tension between the comb plastic and the agarose as you pull up on the comb can tear the bottoms out of the wells, causing loss of samples during loading.\n\nNot using the right % of agarose for your DNA size range of interest.\n\nResult: bands you care about won’t resolve optimally (i.e., you might not be able to accurately measure the sizes of your bands and might not be able to tell if something is one band or multiple bands). Pour a higher percentage gel to resolve large fragments (e.g. less than 1%) or a lower percentage gel (i.e. between 1 and 4%) to resolve small to very small ones, depending on your needs/expectations for what size bands you will see, how many of them, or how important it is to accurately estimate their sizes.\n\nNot homogeneously mixing the Safeview into the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: DNA might not be visible in all parts of the gel.\n\nOver-cooling the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: Safeview will not be evenly distributed in the gel, and/or the gel have lumps and not be of uniform thickness because some of the agarose will have already started polymerizing.\n\nRunning a gel with a lot of bubbles in it.\n\nResult: DNA migration can be impeded/distorted by bubbles in the gel. Usually as a gel is cooling, bubbles will migrate to the top where (usually) they will be out of the path of the DNA unless the DNA volume fills the wells to the top. But bubbles can sometimes occur deeper in the gel – particularly in a very high % agarose gel. Try to nudge bubbles out of the way before the gel solidifies, either by raking them with a comb that is not on a holder or nudging individual bubbles with a pipette tip before the gel congeals. If the gel is already solid, avoid loading in lanes that will run across a bubble.\n\nRunning a gel that wasn’t mixed homogeneously before pouring in the mold.\n\nResult: there will be lumps in the gel of more dense agarose that will cause distortion of how the DNA migrates.\n\nAccidentally contacting the agarose with a pipette tip.\n\nResult: the bottom or side of the well can become perforated, causing the sample to leak out the bottom or into the next well. If the tip is pressed against the agarose, the sample can be forcefully and suddenly expelled and blast out of the well.\n\nOverloading the wells with too much sample volume.\n\nResult: samples can become cross-contaminated by DNA from adjacent wells.\n\nOverloading the lane with too much DNA.\n\nResult: DNA can become retarded during running and the apparent size will not be accurately gauged by the ladder.\n\nForgetting to load a DNA ladder.\n\nResult: you won’t know if your DNA bands are the right size when you look at and photograph your gel.\n\nNot using gel loading mix in the DNA or using ladder that isn’t premixed with gel loading mix.\n\nResult: The DNA or ladder (which is also DNA) will be lost mostly during loading without the gel loading mix that makes it sink to the bottom of the wells in the gel and stay there while you are loading. Both your samples and the ladder are DNA in an aqueous solution that is about the same density as the buffer (usually) – therefore they both should have gel loading mix in them in order to be denser than the tank buffer. The gel loading mix also includes convenient, charged dyes that migrate at different rates to help you see that your gel is running and how far it has progressed. The gel loading mix types only really matter if one type happens to have a dye that migrates exactly like your band of interest - in that case, you may want to switch to a different mix so that the dye doesn’t block the fluorescence of your band during visualization.\n\nNot thoroughly mixing gel loading mix into your DNA before loading.\n\nResult: you could lose part of your DNA to floating out of the well during loading. (This can also happen if there are other reasons your DNA is not very dense, such as if there is residual ethanol in it from preceding processing. In that case, you will see your DNA rapidly floating up to the surface as soon as you start expelling it from the tip).\n\nAdding premixed DNA ladder to your samples instead of gel loading mix.\n\nResult: ladder will appear in every lane, obscuring your bands and wasting expensive ladder.\n\nForgetting to start the current on your loaded gel.\n\nResult: DNA will diffuse both out of the wells and into the gel in all directions causing loss of some of the DNA and blurriness of the remaining DNA once the gel is run. Diffusion can also happen if it takes a long time to load the gel. If there are a great number of samples to load – such as in a two- or three-comb gel, it is often best to load one tier and run the gel for 5 minutes so the DNA enters the gel and diffuses more slowly before moving on to load the next tier. Diffusion can happen more quickly if the buffer is warm from a previous run. If the buffer is warm, replace it before trying to load another gel in the same box.\n\nNot keeping track of the order of sample loading.\n\nResult: you won’t know which lane corresponds to which sample. This can happen, for example, when loading samples from a strip of PCR tubes, where their order can accidentally be rotated 180 degrees, or when loading from a PCR plate, where the plate orientation can be rotated 180 or 90 degrees (e.g., wells are loaded with respect to rows versus columns).\n\nRunning your gel backwards by accidentally reversing the positive and negative electrodes.\n\nResult, your DNA will migrate out of the end of the gel nearest the wells (the “top” of the gel) and be lost into the tank buffer. Always check that your electrodes are hooked up to the correct leads relative to the terminals at the power source, that your gel is oriented so that the DNA will run toward the positive pole. If you have already loaded your gel in the wrong orientation, do not lift the gel out of the tank, but just reverse the leads (red to black) to correct the current. Remember that DNA is negatively charged and will run to the positive (red) pole. When you start the current, the negative electrode (anode) at the well end of the gel should be making noticeably more bubbles than the positive electrode (cathode) at the bottom end of the gel. That’s because electrolysis of water (H2O) will produce twice as much free hydrogen at the anode than the cathode makes free oxygen. Making a habit of checking that tells you two things: that current is really flowing and that you do have the right orientation of poles.\n\nRunning a gel at too low a voltage.\n\nResult: low molecular weight bands may look fuzzy and faint because they will be diffusing in random directions as they migrate.\n\nRunning DNA that is too salty - e.g., DNA in Phusion buffer or in NEB restriction buffer 3 (or 3.1) etc.\n\nResult: a “salt front” will form where DNA in those salty buffers will be slowed (“retarded”) relative to the ladder, making the ladder a useless measure of the actual size of the DNA. Bands will be compressed at a “front” and will be a weird shape like a smile or a frown rather than a straight band.\nIf you know your DNA is in a salty buffer, you can remove this problem by cleaning the DNA first (i.e., via a cleanup column or with paramagnetic beads), or you can mitigate the problem by diluting only a few microliters (e.g. 5 µl) of your DNA into water and gel loading mix before loading (assuming you have a high enough concentration of DNA that it can still be seen if you load only a small fraction of it).\n\nRunning a gel made up in a different buffer (or different concentration of buffer) than the buffer in the gel tank; this includes using old buffer that has been evaporating in the tank through multiple runs or over time.\n\nResult: bands will not migrate as expected. “Fronts” may form where the leading edge of the migrating DNA is compressed.\n\nLosing your gel of the end of the gel mold when you are taking it out of the tank.\n\nResult: the gel could shatter and be unsalvageable. Solution: transport gels in a dish and be especially careful when moving flabby, low percentage agarose gels (under 1%)."

Just leave the lid off when heating agarose.\n\nAdding Safeview to molten agarose that is too hot.\n\nResult: much of the Safeview will be degraded by heat, causing your DNA to be hard to see or image. The plastic gel mold could be permanently warped if the agarose is too hot. The tape may fail, causing a mess in the fume hood and reagent wastage. A swirled bottle should be just comfortable (70 degrees C or a bit less).\n\nRunning a gel at too high a voltage.\n\nResult: buffer could overheat during running and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box. Bands might look smear and not be well resolved.\n\nDissolving agarose in water instead of electrophoresis buffer or putting water in the electrophoresis tank instead of buffer.\n\nResult - total failure for DNA to migrate into the gel, loss of samples. If there is only water and not buffer in the tank, it could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box.\n\nOver-running your gel.\n\nResult: the DNA might run off the bottom of the gel and be lost. If you had more than one tier of wells in the gel, the DNA in the top tier will run into the zone of the next tier down, causing distortion and blurriness of the bands as they cross the wells of the lower tier and creating confusion in interpretation because very small fragments from the top tier will be overlapping very large fragments of the lower tier. If the gel runs for a long time, the buffer could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box."

After pulling combs from a polymerized gel, make sure to really rub them under a flow of water; a skin of polymerized agarose left on the combs (higher percentages of agarose are especially prone to this) will mean the next person has to clean this off before they can pour a gel. Likewise, make sure the gel melting bottle is rinsed immediately after you pour your gel. If residual agarose is allowed to dry in the bottle, it can create an almost insoluble blob in the gel of the next person to use the bottle. If you see that some of your agarose has polymerized in the bottle, add water to the bottle and microwave it for a few minutes to dissolve and discard the residue."

    "text": "Procedure\n\nHatch and harvest the brine shrimp (see brine shrimp hatching and feeding SOP).\nTransfer into a specimen cup with clean seawater to resuspend them. Fill the specimen cup with new seawater until it reaches 1L.\nDilute the brine shrimp. Assuming an 80% hatch rate from the 1 g of brine shrimp eggs about 200,000 nauplii will hatch. For further culturing the recommended density is 1,000-2,000 brine shrimp/L. As many will be lost in the culturing process shooting for a higher density will result in more alive at the end. Add between 300-400 mL of the brine shrimp to a 5-gallon (18L) conical hatching jar (made to 30-35 ppt) ensuring that the brine shrimp are suspended in the specimen cup and not settled at the bottom.\n\nProvide a lid to reduce evaporation and proper aeration. Make sure the tube extends as far down as possible to eliminate the possibility of a “dead zone”\n\nFeed the brine shrimp. Brine shrimp do not eat for the first 48 hrs. of their life cycle as they absorb nutrients from their yolk sac. After 48 hr. feed the brine shrimp High-Carotenoid Marine Algae (ordered from brineshrimpdirect.com). Add 1 tsp. of Hi-C Algae to a blender with 0.5L of seawater and blend until smooth. Add this solution to the conical hatching jar for the brine shrimp to feed on. Feed this solution to brine shrimp daily.\n\nStore leftover Hi-C Algae in 50 mL Falcon Tubes sealed with parafilm in the freezer\n\nConduct daily water changes. Since a filtration system cannot be implemented due to the small nature of the brine shrimp, 20-30% water changes should be conducted daily. Remove air from the system and open the stopcock to allow water to exit the container. Filter the water through a fine mesh net to catch any brine shrimp as it exits the conical hatching jar. Immediately transfer those brine shrimp to a specimen container and re-add them to the system. Wipe down and food that has settled along the edge and lid and re-fill the conical hatching jar with clean seawater. Reintroduce the air.\nFeed out the brine shrimp. It takes around 8-12 days for the brine shrimp to reach their full size of 7mm (this amount of time will change depending on how optimum the conditions are for the brine shrimp). Once large enough, drain a portion of the container through a fine mesh net and immediately transfer into a specimen cup with clean seawater. Drain this water through a net with larger holes to remove food from the solution (brine shrimp will be large enough at this time to not fall through the holes) into a new specimen cup. Use a turkey baster to allocate food evenly to all of the tanks.\n\n\nDepending on the amount of fish that must be fed the culture may be fed out over a period of multiple days\n\n\nIf the conical hatching jar is completely fed out, restart the culture with new nauplii. For best results stagger the start of the conical hatching jars so brine shrimp will always be growing while you feed out others."

Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced.\nDrain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean air diffuser as instructed below. Clean the tank and all parts thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it.\nSquirt about 10-20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand using a pad or sponge exposing all inside portions of the tank to bleach.\nRinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it.\nReassemble the tank and put it back on the rack. Fill with system water and using a dry erase marker record date/time on the front of the tank.\nAllow water to recirculate for about 30 minutes before adding fish. If adding fish, Watch fish for 15 min after adding them to look for any signs of distress.\n\nInitial check list\nAir diffuser cleaning:\n\nRemove dirty air diffusers from tanks and rinse with tap water to remove excess algae and debris.\nPlace in 10% bleach solution for 15-30 minutes. Please see {#sec-Plastic_Glassware_cleaning-bleach} for bleach and sodium thisolfate instructions.\nRinse with hot water for 5 and then place into 3% sodium thiosulfate for 5 minutes.\nRinse with hot water for 5 minutes.\nWhen cleaned, air diffusers are placed back into aquaria, observe fish for 15 min for signs of distress."

    "text": "Procedure\n\nCyst hydration: Hydrate one full can of dried cyst in 5 L of tap water in a hatching cone with aeration for 1 hour at room temp. Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.\nFilter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.\nTransfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.\nDe-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.\nNeutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.\nDehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Hatching and Feeding Brine SOP)."

When raised in E3 medium at 28.5°C, zebrafish embryos develop normally outside of their chorions. Manually dechorionate embryos, using the following procedure:\n\nWhile using one pair of forceps to hold the chorion, make a tear in the chorion with the other pair of forceps.\nHold the chorion in a region opposite of the tear, and gently push the embryo through the opening by passing the chorion and the embryo between the tips of the other pair of forceps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\n\n\nEmbryos younger than 15 hpf are particularly fragile and great care must be taken not to damage them.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, embryos can be enzymatically dechorionated in bulk using the following procedure:\n\nIncubate the embryos in the Pronase Solution at room temperature for a brief time (typically 1-10 minutes, depending on the embryonic stage). Constantly check the condition of the chorions by gently depressing them with a poker (made by attaching a loop of 6X flyfishing tippet to a capillary tube) and looking at them under a microscope. When the chorions no longer return to a spherical shape, the Pronase treatment is complete.\nThoroughly wash the embryos (3 to 4 times) in E3 mediun to remove the Pronase solution. Using the fire-polished Pasteur pipet, pipet the embryos back and fourth in the E3 medium. The Pronase-treated chorions should break open, releasing the embryos.\nDechorionated embryos should be handled using fire-polished Pasteur pipets to minimize damage."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their molecular size. During gel electrophoresis, an electrical field is used to help molecules travel through the pores of an agarose gel matrix. At one end of the gel, furthest away from where the samples are loaded, is a positive charge, and at the other end is a negative charge. Since DNA and RNA are both negatively charged molecules, they are pulled through the gel matrix towards the positive charge. Since proteins do not have a negative charge, researchers must first mix them with a sodium dodecyl sulfate detergent which gives them the negative charge needed to migrate towards the positive end of the gel. The speed at which molecules travel through the gel is inversely related to their molecular size. For example, small DNA molecules have a low molecular weight, enabling them to travel further through the gel matrix than a larger DNA molecule. When a gel is stained with DNA/RNA/protein-binding dye, these molecules can be seen as bands, whose location along the length of the gel represents the molecule?s size in terms of number of base pairs. When dye-stained DNA/RNA/protein is run beside a ladder with known fragment size, one can estimate the size of the assayed molecule. After the DNA/RNA/protein molecules have been separated using gel electrophoresis, the gel is imaged under UV light, visualizing the DNA/RNA/proteins present across the length of the gel."

    "text": "Procedure\n\nWeigh desired amount of Molecular Biology Grade Agarose - scale, weigh paper, and Agarose located on the common use bench on the north end of the laboratory - and pour it into the 500 ml Corning glass bottle labeled “Agarose Gels” (located on top of or inside the microwave on the south end of the laboratory).\n\n1-1.2% Agarose (1 g-1.2 g) is a good starting amount of Agarose for DNA samples, though the amount of Agarose can vary depending on your particular samples and goals. The concentration of Agarose in a gel depends on the sizes of DNA fragments to be separated, with most gels ranging between 0.5%-2% Agarose.\n\nFill bottle with 0.5X TBE buffer, located in the 20-liter Nalgene located at the south sink. The volume of TBE buffer used will be based on the size of the gel mold. For example, for a 14”x10” gel tray, use 100 ml of 0.5X TBE buffer. 3. Put bottle in microwave and microwave for one minute.\nUsing the heat mittens located on top of the microwave, remove the bottle from the microwave, swirl the mixture around, and put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds. By the end of this step, the Agarose should be melted into the TBE and there should be no remaining solid Agarose particles.\nUsing the heat mittens, remove the bottle from the microwave and carry it to the fume hood.\nSelect a gel tray from the drawer under the gel boxes. Put tape around the two longest sides of the gel tray, pressing tape on firmly so it is air-tight with the tray. The distance between the top of the tape and the bottom of the tray should be at least half-an-inch tall so that it can hold all of the liquid from the Agarose Gel bottle without it spilling over the sides or leaking through any air gaps in the tape.\nSelect a gel comb from the drawer under the gel boxes. Different combs make different sized wells that can hold different volumes, so select a comb based on your specific experiment. Place the gel comb in the notches of the gel tray. The combs should not touch the bottom of the tray but be slightly above it.\nLet the agarose solution cool for a few minutes. Using the heat mittens, swirl the Agarose Gel bottle again. Add 5 ul of Safe View (located in the Styrofoam box in the fume hood) to the Agarose Gel bottle. Gently swirl the bottle to mix in the Safe View; try to avoid creating bubbles while swirling.\nSlowly pour the Agarose Gel mixture into the gel tray with gel comb. Be careful not to create bubbles in the gel mixture while pouring. If there are bubbles, pop or move them to the bottom of the tray, away from the comb. Slowly lift the comb up and down a few times to ensure there are no bubbles around the comb.\nLet the gel mixture sit in the tray under the hood until it solidifies (usually takes around 20 minutes).\nWhile you are waiting for the gel to solidify, clean the Agarose Gel bottle. Fill the bottle halfway with water, swirl the water, microwave for 30 seconds, swirl again and microwave for another 30 seconds. Pour out the water and set the bottle out to dry next to the microwave.\nOnce the agarose mixture has solidified, carefully remove the tape from the sides of the tray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is important\n\n\n\nTape should be removed from the tray while held under the fume hood. Tape should be removed slowly to prevent any splattering of residual liquid on the top of the solidified gel.\n\n\nCarefully remove the comb from the gel matrix by slowly pulling it straight up.\nCarry the gel in the gel plate to the gel boxes, remove gel box lid, and slowly lower the gel and plate into gel boxes.\nLoad ladder* of choice into the left-most well of the gel. The volume of ladder you load will vary depending on your experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is important\n\n\n\nWhen expelling the ladder into the well, only pipet to the first stop. Pipetting to the second stop risks expelling bubbles into the well which could interfere with the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n\n*The ladder is made of DNA and needs a gel loading dye. When selecting a ladder to use, make sure that the ladder is not clear but has been mixed with a loading dye (should be a bright color like blue, orange, green, or purple).\n\n\nPrepare DNA samples to be loaded into the wells of the gel. Pipet out 10 ul of DNA* from each sample onto a piece of parafilm or into a PCR strip tube, using a fresh pipet tip for each sample to avoid cross contamination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n\n*The volume of DNA you mix load into each well depends on the concentration of DNA and how much of DNA of your total you can afford to use for the gel, though a generally good concentration range is 10-100 ng/ul to ensure the DNA can be visualized on the gel. If you are aiming to load a specific concentration of DNA into each well, calculate the concentration of your DNA sample and find that the corresponding volume is less than 10 ul, you can add the appropriate volume of EB Buffer to bring the sample’s volume up to 10 ul.\n\n\nAdd 2 ul of 6X Loading Dye* to each DNA sample. Thoroughly mix the dye and DNA sample by aspiration, but mix slowly to avoid creating bubbles. Be sure to use a fresh pipet tip in between DNA samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n\n*The exact volume of loading dye you add to each sample can change depending on the amount of DNA you add, but the final dilution should be 1 part 6X Loading Dye to 5 parts DNA sample.\n\n\nLoad 10 ul of the DNA sample/dye mixture into the next available well in the gel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is important\n\n\n\n*When expelling the DNA sample/dye mixture into the well, only pipet to the first stop. Pipetting to the second stop risks expelling bubbles into the well which could interfere with the experiment.\n\n\nPut gel box cover on. Attach the electrodes to the metal posts at the top and bottom of gel box; the black electrode (-) attaches to the metal post on the top of the box and the red electrode (+) attaches to the metal post on the bottom of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n\nSince DNA is a negatively charged molecule, it will run through the gel matrix towards a positive charge. A helpful way to remember electrode placement, then, is “Run to red,” since the red electrode has a positive charge and should be placed furthest away from the DNA samples.\n\n\nTurn on the Bio-Rad PowerPac and set it to your desired voltage. Press “Run.” You can check to see if an electric current is running through the gel box by looking for a stream of small bubbles rising up the back of the gel box.\nRun samples for desired time.\nPress the “Stop” button on the Bio-Rad PowerPac and turn off the power. Remove the electrodes from either end of the gel box, loosely wind them up and place them above or next to the Bio-Rad PowerPac.\nRemove the lid from the gel box. Carefully lift the gel tray out of the gel box, ensuring that the gel does not slide off the tray. Place the gel tray and gel onto the gel transferring tray (located behind the faucet on the south sink). Carry the gel to the gel imaging station (Azure Biosystems c200) in the Phillips Microfluidics Laboratory (Pacific 314).\nTo image the gel,\n\nOpen the door of the c200 Azure Biosystems gel imaging station, and carefully slide the gel inside. The long side of the gel should be facing the opening of the imaging station. Position the gel so that it is centered inside the imaging platform, and the short sides of the gel are parallel to the sides of the imaging platform. Close the door.\nSelect the “cSeries Capture Software” on the screen.\nSelect the “GEL” option in the top left corner, to the right of the “GALLERY” option.\nSelect the “BRIGHT BANDS” option in the bottom right corner.\nSelect “CAPTURE” to take an image of the gel.\nOnce your image has been captured, you may rotate, flip, crop, or zoom in/out of the image.\nTo print the image, select “PRINT” and choose the number of copies you would like to print.\n\nOpen the door of the c200 Azure Biosystems gel imaging station and carefully remove the gel. Wipe down the gel platform using a Kimwipe and close the door.\nCarry your gel and printed images back to the lab. You may either dispose of your gel in the trash or store the gel in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for future use.\nRise off the gel transferring tray and set it to dry behind the south sink faucets. Rinse off the gel tray and the gel comb, ensuring that there is no remaining agarose between the tines of the gel comb. Set the comb and the tray to dry on the drying rack hanging above the south sink."

This includes water changes, removing ?deads?, fixing, euthanizing and any other procedures regarding the fish. If the fish are to be raised past hatching please contact Mark, prior to hatching, to make arrangements for putting fish into the system. Also, please see Mark prior to initial use of incubator for brief training.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nRaise Embryos (check daily):\n\nEmbryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7 days. 48hr stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate. A beating heart can be seen after ~72hr. Check petri dishes daily and remove deads and those with arrested development. Change embryo medium at 3-4 dpf and more if warranted.\n\nHatching, Begin Feeding Brine Shrimp, and Move to System (t = 7-8 days post fertilization):\n\nAfter hatching at 7-8 days post fertilization, remove chorions and allow young to absorb yolk (2-3 days). At approximately day 2 post hatching take petri dish containing fry out of incubator and place dishes on a table. To each petri dish add approximately the same volume of system water, as there is embryo medium; this will double the volume of liquid in the dish. This acclimates the fry to the system water. Allow the fry to acclimate for 15-20 minutes, the longer the better. Then transfer fry to small aquaria on the system.

    "text": "Procedures\n\nSqueeze Female\n\nGravid females can be identified by those that have large rounded abdomens and a slightly extended cloaca. If you can see individual eggs in the abdomen this is an indication that the eggs are old.\n\n\nCover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female.\nIf eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready or the eggs are too old.\nRemove eggs by slightly squeezing the abdomen starting just posterior of the pectoral girdle towards the cloaca expelling the eggs into a 25mm sterile petri dish.\nNote the stock number of the female on the petri dish.\n\n\nThe small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs.\n\n\n\nDissect Testes From Male\n\nEuthanize male by placing him into a small container containing a lethal volume of MS222.\nClean a large, 30cm by 60cm or similar size, glass sheet, fine scissors, and forceps with 95% ethanol.\nWhen male is motionless and not responding in accordance with the Stickleback Adult Euthanasia procedure {#sec-husbandry_stickleback_adult_euthansisa}, remove and the fish and place on the glass sheet. Sever the spinal cord behind skull using a razor to be sure of euthanization.\nUse scissors to make incision from the cloaca anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making the incision along the mid line of the fish.\nMake another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed.\n\n\nIncisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface.\n\n\nLocate paired testes and vas deferens.\n\n\nTestes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects.\n\n\nUse fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes.\n\n\nDoing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution.\n\n\n\nStoring of Testes\n\nIf only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4.\nOtherwise, place testes into 15 ml tube filled with cold Testes Solution and label tube with make stock number and date.\nStore testes at 4°C.\nTo store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week.\n\n\n\nPrepare Testis\n\nIf multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male’s testes, place both testes on the inside lid of the 25mm petri dish into which a females eggs have been squeezed.\nUsing a sterile razor to macerate testis.\n\n\nUnder a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a ‘sparkling’ refraction.\n\n\nAdd approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testes prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time, using same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture. Label petri dish(s) with male stock number and time/date of fertilization.\nLeave sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes.\nAdd embryo medium to cover the embryos.\nPlace in incubator at 20°C.\n\n\n\nSeparation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr)\n\nThe animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5 - 2 hr post fertilization. During this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos.\n\n\nAfter 2 hours post fertilization, use the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish.\nRemove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos.\nRinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium.\nEnter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C.\n\n\n\nRaise Embryos (check daily)\n\nEmbryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7-9 days. 48 to 52 hpf stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate. A beating heart can be seen after ~72hr.\n\n\nCheck petri dishes daily and remove embryos that have arrested development.\nChange of embryo medium at 3-4 dpf and more if water has fouled.\nRecord health checks on incubator checklist."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nPurpose: To help members of the laboratory run the perfect gels - every time.\nProcedure Type: Molecular\nSpecies: N/A\nAuthors\n\nSusan Bassham\n\n\nThe effect of electrophoresis is to separate DNA fragments by size in an agarose matrix and buffer using an electrical current. DNA is negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive pole. Many parameters can affect how the DNA moves through the gel: buffer composition, voltage, length of the gel, percentage of agarose in the gel (in other words, the density of the gel matrix), presence of salt in the DNA, protein bound to DNA, and other factors. Some of these conditions also affect which size ranges of DNA will effectively be “resolved” (i.e., separated enough from one another so you can see them as distinct fragment sizes). “Safeview” is a dye we use in the gel that fluoresces under UV or blue light when bound to DNA, allowing us to see and photograph it when viewed through a special orange filter to cut out the background light. The research goals of using electrophoresis might include:\n\nmeasuring the size of fragments in a DNA sample such as the products of PCR or assessing the intactness of the purified DNA from a tissue extraction\nseparating fragments from one another so that a particular amplicon or size range of DNA can be purified out of the gel for other downstream applications (such as for cloning a PCR fragment for making probes or for Sanger sequencing, or for size selecting a smear of fragments for making a RAD library) while excluding the other fragment sizes\nchecking for the presence or absence of a particular product of PCR as in a screen for orientation of a cloned fragment in a plasmid present in different bacterial colonies, a screen for an insertion in a transgenic animal, a screen to determine the genetic sex or the mitotype of a fish."

    "section": "Common Mistakes",
    "text": "Common Mistakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThese common mistakes will give you a big headache when trying to run gels\n\n\n\nBoiling over the agarose when making a gel.\n\nResult: failure to monitor the agarose when you are trying to dissolve it in the microwave can easily cause it to boil over because powdered substances create a lot of “nodes of nucleation” for bubbles to form. This is especially easy to accidentally do with higher percentages of agarose. It wastes expensive agarose and creates a mess in the microwave. What remains in the bottle will be of an indeterminate percentage/gel stiffness.\n\nNot making sure the tape is adhering well to the mold before casting a gel.\n\nResult: liquid agarose will leak out causing a mess and reagent waste. Make sure the mold is dry beforehand, and use the back edge of a comb, e.g., to run across the tape and make sure it has firm contact.\n\nPositioning the comb teeth too close to one side or to the bottom of the mold when setting up for pouring a gel.\n\nResult: the bottoms (or that side) of wells may be torn when the comb is pulled out, causing the loaded samples to leak out into the buffer during gel loading. Note: even when the comb teeth are not too close to the bottom, low percentage gels are soft and will benefit from having the comb pulled while submerged in the tank - otherwise the suction created by surface tension between the comb plastic and the agarose as you pull up on the comb can tear the bottoms out of the wells, causing loss of samples during loading.\n\nNot using the right % of agarose for your DNA size range of interest.\n\nResult: bands you care about won’t resolve optimally (i.e., you might not be able to accurately measure the sizes of your bands and might not be able to tell if something is one band or multiple bands). Pour a higher percentage gel to resolve large fragments (e.g. less than 1%) or a lower percentage gel (i.e. between 1 and 4%) to resolve small to very small ones, depending on your needs/expectations for what size bands you will see, how many of them, or how important it is to accurately estimate their sizes.\n\nNot homogeneously mixing the Safeview into the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: DNA might not be visible in all parts of the gel.\n\nOver-cooling the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: Safeview will not be evenly distributed in the gel, and/or the gel have lumps and not be of uniform thickness because some of the agarose will have already started polymerizing.\n\nRunning a gel with a lot of bubbles in it.\n\nResult: DNA migration can be impeded/distorted by bubbles in the gel. Usually as a gel is cooling, bubbles will migrate to the top where (usually) they will be out of the path of the DNA unless the DNA volume fills the wells to the top. But bubbles can sometimes occur deeper in the gel – particularly in a very high % agarose gel. Try to nudge bubbles out of the way before the gel solidifies, either by raking them with a comb that is not on a holder or nudging individual bubbles with a pipette tip before the gel congeals. If the gel is already solid, avoid loading in lanes that will run across a bubble.\n\nRunning a gel that wasn’t mixed homogeneously before pouring in the mold.\n\nResult: there will be lumps in the gel of more dense agarose that will cause distortion of how the DNA migrates.\n\nAccidentally contacting the agarose with a pipette tip.\n\nResult: the bottom or side of the well can become perforated, causing the sample to leak out the bottom or into the next well. If the tip is pressed against the agarose, the sample can be forcefully and suddenly expelled and blast out of the well.\n\nOverloading the wells with too much sample volume.\n\nResult: samples can become cross-contaminated by DNA from adjacent wells.\n\nOverloading the lane with too much DNA.\n\nResult: DNA can become retarded during running and the apparent size will not be accurately gauged by the ladder.\n\nForgetting to load a DNA ladder.\n\nResult: you won’t know if your DNA bands are the right size when you look at and photograph your gel.\n\nNot using gel loading mix in the DNA or using ladder that isn’t premixed with gel loading mix.\n\nResult: The DNA or ladder (which is also DNA) will be lost mostly during loading without the gel loading mix that makes it sink to the bottom of the wells in the gel and stay there while you are loading. Both your samples and the ladder are DNA in an aqueous solution that is about the same density as the buffer (usually) – therefore they both should have gel loading mix in them in order to be denser than the tank buffer. The gel loading mix also includes convenient, charged dyes that migrate at different rates to help you see that your gel is running and how far it has progressed. The gel loading mix types only really matter if one type happens to have a dye that migrates exactly like your band of interest - in that case, you may want to switch to a different mix so that the dye doesn’t block the fluorescence of your band during visualization.\n\nNot thoroughly mixing gel loading mix into your DNA before loading.\n\nResult: you could lose part of your DNA to floating out of the well during loading. (This can also happen if there are other reasons your DNA is not very dense, such as if there is residual ethanol in it from preceding processing. In that case, you will see your DNA rapidly floating up to the surface as soon as you start expelling it from the tip).\n\nAdding premixed DNA ladder to your samples instead of gel loading mix.\n\nResult: ladder will appear in every lane, obscuring your bands and wasting expensive ladder.\n\nForgetting to start the current on your loaded gel.\n\nResult: DNA will diffuse both out of the wells and into the gel in all directions causing loss of some of the DNA and blurriness of the remaining DNA once the gel is run. Diffusion can also happen if it takes a long time to load the gel. If there are a great number of samples to load – such as in a two- or three-comb gel, it is often best to load one tier and run the gel for 5 minutes so the DNA enters the gel and diffuses more slowly before moving on to load the next tier. Diffusion can happen more quickly if the buffer is warm from a previous run. If the buffer is warm, replace it before trying to load another gel in the same box.\n\nNot keeping track of the order of sample loading.\n\nResult: you won’t know which lane corresponds to which sample. This can happen, for example, when loading samples from a strip of PCR tubes, where their order can accidentally be rotated 180 degrees, or when loading from a PCR plate, where the plate orientation can be rotated 180 or 90 degrees (e.g., wells are loaded with respect to rows versus columns).\n\nRunning your gel backwards by accidentally reversing the positive and negative electrodes.\n\nResult, your DNA will migrate out of the end of the gel nearest the wells (the “top” of the gel) and be lost into the tank buffer. Always check that your electrodes are hooked up to the correct leads relative to the terminals at the power source, that your gel is oriented so that the DNA will run toward the positive pole. If you have already loaded your gel in the wrong orientation, do not lift the gel out of the tank, but just reverse the leads (red to black) to correct the current. Remember that DNA is negatively charged and will run to the positive (red) pole. When you start the current, the negative electrode (anode) at the well end of the gel should be making noticeably more bubbles than the positive electrode (cathode) at the bottom end of the gel. That’s because electrolysis of water (H2O) will produce twice as much free hydrogen at the anode than the cathode makes free oxygen. Making a habit of checking that tells you two things: that current is really flowing and that you do have the right orientation of poles.\n\nRunning a gel at too low a voltage.\n\nResult: low molecular weight bands may look fuzzy and faint because they will be diffusing in random directions as they migrate.\n\nRunning DNA that is too salty - e.g., DNA in Phusion buffer or in NEB restriction buffer 3 (or 3.1) etc.\n\nResult: a “salt front” will form where DNA in those salty buffers will be slowed (“retarded”) relative to the ladder, making the ladder a useless measure of the actual size of the DNA. Bands will be compressed at a “front” and will be a weird shape like a smile or a frown rather than a straight band.\nIf you know your DNA is in a salty buffer, you can remove this problem by cleaning the DNA first (i.e., via a cleanup column or with paramagnetic beads), or you can mitigate the problem by diluting only a few microliters (e.g. 5 µl) of your DNA into water and gel loading mix before loading (assuming you have a high enough concentration of DNA that it can still be seen if you load only a small fraction of it).\n\nRunning a gel made up in a different buffer (or different concentration of buffer) than the buffer in the gel tank; this includes using old buffer that has been evaporating in the tank through multiple runs or over time.\n\nResult: bands will not migrate as expected. “Fronts” may form where the leading edge of the migrating DNA is compressed.\n\nLosing your gel of the end of the gel mold when you are taking it out of the tank.\n\nResult: the gel could shatter and be unsalvageable. Solution: transport gels in a dish and be especially careful when moving flabby, low percentage agarose gels (under 1%)."

Just leave the lid off when heating agarose.\n\nAdding Safeview to molten agarose that is too hot.\n\nResult: much of the Safeview will be degraded by heat, causing your DNA to be hard to see or image. The plastic gel mold could be permanently warped if the agarose is too hot. The tape may fail, causing a mess in the fume hood and reagent wastage. A swirled bottle should be just comfortable (70 degrees C or a bit less).\n\nRunning a gel at too high a voltage.\n\nResult: buffer could overheat during running and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box. Bands might look smear and not be well resolved.\n\nDissolving agarose in water instead of electrophoresis buffer or putting water in the electrophoresis tank instead of buffer.\n\nResult - total failure for DNA to migrate into the gel, loss of samples. If there is only water and not buffer in the tank, it could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box.\n\nOver-running your gel.\n\nResult: the DNA might run off the bottom of the gel and be lost. If you had more than one tier of wells in the gel, the DNA in the top tier will run into the zone of the next tier down, causing distortion and blurriness of the bands as they cross the wells of the lower tier and creating confusion in interpretation because very small fragments from the top tier will be overlapping very large fragments of the lower tier. If the gel runs for a long time, the buffer could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box."

The next person shouldn’t have to fish another lab mate’s combs and molds out of the sink and clean and dry them before they can pour their gel. After pulling combs from a polymerized gel, make sure to really rub them under a flow of water; a skin of polymerized agarose left on the combs (higher percentages of agarose are especially prone to this) will mean the next person has to clean this off before they can pour a gel. Likewise, make sure the gel melting bottle is rinsed immediately after you pour your gel. If residual agarose is allowed to dry in the bottle, it can create an almost insoluble blob in the gel of the next person to use the bottle. If you see that some of your agarose has polymerized in the bottle, add water to the bottle and microwave it for a few minutes to dissolve and discard the residue."

    "text": "Introduction\nTo finish off the programming section, we’re going to give you a quick tour of the most important base R functions that we don’t otherwise discuss in the book. These tools are particularly useful as you do more programming and will help you read code you’ll encounter in the wild.\nThis is a good place to remind you that the tidyverse is not the only way to solve data science problems. We teach the tidyverse in this book because tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, increasing the consistency across functions, and making each new function or package a little easier to learn and use. It’s not possible to use the tidyverse without using base R, so we’ve actually already taught you a lot of base R functions: from library() to load packages, to sum() and mean() for numeric summaries, to the factor, date, and POSIXct data types, and of course all the basic operators like +, -, /, *, |, &, and !. What we haven’t focused on so far is base R workflows, so we will highlight a few of those in this chapter.\nAfter you read this book, you’ll learn other approaches to the same problems using base R, data.table, and other packages. You’ll undoubtedly encounter these other approaches when you start reading R code written by others, particularly if you’re using StackOverflow. It’s 100% okay to write code that uses a mix of approaches, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!\nIn this chapter, we’ll focus on four big topics: subsetting with [, subsetting with [[ and $, the apply family of functions, and for loops. To finish off, we’ll briefly discuss two essential plotting functions.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis package focuses on base R so doesn’t have any real prerequisites, but we’ll load the tidyverse in order to explain some of the differences.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)"

    "section": "Selecting multiple elements with [",
    "text": "Selecting multiple elements with [\n[ is used to extract sub-components from vectors and data frames, and is called like x[i] or x[i, j]. In this section, we’ll introduce you to the power of [, first showing you how you can use it with vectors, then how the same principles extend in a straightforward way to two-dimensional (2d) structures like data frames. We’ll then help you cement that knowledge by showing how various dplyr verbs are special cases of [.\n\nSubsetting vectors\nThere are five main types of things that you can subset a vector with, i.e., that can be the i in x[i]:\n\nA vector of positive integers. Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\")\nx[c(3, 2, 5)]\n\n[1] \"three\" \"two\"   \"five\" \n\n\nBy repeating a position, you can actually make a longer output than input, making the term “subsetting” a bit of a misnomer.\n\nx[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]\n\n[1] \"one\"  \"one\"  \"five\" \"five\" \"five\" \"two\" \n\n\nA vector of negative integers. Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:\n\nx[c(-1, -3, -5)]\n\n[1] \"two\"  \"four\"\n\n\nA logical vector. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a TRUE value. This is most often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.\n\nx &lt;- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)\n\n# All non-missing values of x\nx[!is.na(x)]\n\n[1] 10  3  5  8  1\n\n# All even (or missing!) values of x\nx[x %% 2 == 0]\n\n[1] 10 NA  8 NA\n\n\nUnlike filter(), NA indices will be included in the output as NAs.\nA character vector. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:\n\nx &lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)\nx[c(\"xyz\", \"def\")]\n\nxyz def \n  5   2 \n\n\nAs with subsetting with positive integers, you can use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.\nNothing. The final type of subsetting is nothing, x[], which returns the complete x. This is not useful for subsetting vectors, but as we’ll see shortly, it is useful when subsetting 2d structures like tibbles."

Compared to approaches discussed elsewhere in the book, these functions tend to have more of a “vector” flavor than a “data frame” flavor because base R functions tend to take individual vectors, rather than a data frame and some column specification. This often makes life easier for programming and so becomes more important as you write more functions and begin to write your own packages.\nThis chapter concludes the programming section of the book. You’ve made a solid start on your journey to becoming not just a data scientist who uses R, but a data scientist who can program in R. We hope these chapters have sparked your interest in programming and that you’re looking forward to learning more outside of this book."
