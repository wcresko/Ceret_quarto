    "text": "Procedure\n\nComplete bleaching and cleaning of tank. This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months.\n\nRemove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced.\nDrain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean air diffuser as instructed below. Clean the tank and all parts thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it.\nSquirt about 10-20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand using a pad or sponge exposing all inside portions of the tank to bleach.\nRinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it.\nReassemble the tank and put it back on the rack. Fill with system water and using a dry erase marker record date/time on the front of the tank.\nAllow water to recirculate for about 30 minutes before adding fish. If adding fish, Watch fish for 15 min after adding them to look for any signs of distress.\n\nInitial check list\nAir diffuser cleaning:\n\nRemove dirty air diffusers from tanks and rinse with tap water to remove excess algae and debris.\nPlace in 10% bleach solution for 15-30 minutes. Please see {#sec-Plastic_Glassware_cleaning-bleach} for bleach and sodium thisolfate instructions.\nRinse with hot water for 5 and then place into 3% sodium thiosulfate for 5 minutes.\nRinse with hot water for 5 minutes.\nWhen cleaned, air diffusers are placed back into aquaria, observe fish for 15 min for signs of distress."
