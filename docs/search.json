Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.\nFilter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.\nTransfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.\nDe-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.\nNeutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.\nDehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Hatching and Feeding Brine SOP)."

    "text": "Introduction\nTo finish off the programming section, we’re going to give you a quick tour of the most important base R functions that we don’t otherwise discuss in the book. These tools are particularly useful as you do more programming and will help you read code you’ll encounter in the wild.\nThis is a good place to remind you that the tidyverse is not the only way to solve data science problems. We teach the tidyverse in this book because tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, increasing the consistency across functions, and making each new function or package a little easier to learn and use. It’s not possible to use the tidyverse without using base R, so we’ve actually already taught you a lot of base R functions: from library() to load packages, to sum() and mean() for numeric summaries, to the factor, date, and POSIXct data types, and of course all the basic operators like +, -, /, *, |, &, and !. What we haven’t focused on so far is base R workflows, so we will highlight a few of those in this chapter.\nAfter you read this book, you’ll learn other approaches to the same problems using base R, data.table, and other packages. You’ll undoubtedly encounter these other approaches when you start reading R code written by others, particularly if you’re using StackOverflow. It’s 100% okay to write code that uses a mix of approaches, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!\nIn this chapter, we’ll focus on four big topics: subsetting with [, subsetting with [[ and $, the apply family of functions, and for loops. To finish off, we’ll briefly discuss two essential plotting functions.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis package focuses on base R so doesn’t have any real prerequisites, but we’ll load the tidyverse in order to explain some of the differences.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)"

In this section, we’ll introduce you to the power of [, first showing you how you can use it with vectors, then how the same principles extend in a straightforward way to two-dimensional (2d) structures like data frames. We’ll then help you cement that knowledge by showing how various dplyr verbs are special cases of [.\n\nSubsetting vectors\nThere are five main types of things that you can subset a vector with, i.e., that can be the i in x[i]:\n\nA vector of positive integers. Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:\n\nx &lt;- c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\")\nx[c(3, 2, 5)]\n\n[1] \"three\" \"two\"   \"five\" \n\n\nBy repeating a position, you can actually make a longer output than input, making the term “subsetting” a bit of a misnomer.\n\nx[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]\n\n[1] \"one\"  \"one\"  \"five\" \"five\" \"five\" \"two\" \n\n\nA vector of negative integers. Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:\n\nx[c(-1, -3, -5)]\n\n[1] \"two\"  \"four\"\n\n\nA logical vector. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a TRUE value. This is most often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.\n\nx &lt;- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)\n\n# All non-missing values of x\nx[!is.na(x)]\n\n[1] 10  3  5  8  1\n\n# All even (or missing!) values of x\nx[x %% 2 == 0]\n\n[1] 10 NA  8 NA\n\n\nUnlike filter(), NA indices will be included in the output as NAs.\nA character vector. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:\n\nx &lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)\nx[c(\"xyz\", \"def\")]\n\nxyz def \n  5   2 \n\n\nAs with subsetting with positive integers, you can use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.\nNothing. The final type of subsetting is nothing, x[], which returns the complete x. This is not useful for subsetting vectors, but as we’ll see shortly, it is useful when subsetting 2d structures like tibbles."

    "text": "Summary\nIn this chapter, we’ve shown you a selection of base R functions useful for subsetting and iteration. Compared to approaches discussed elsewhere in the book, these functions tend to have more of a “vector” flavor than a “data frame” flavor because base R functions tend to take individual vectors, rather than a data frame and some column specification. This often makes life easier for programming and so becomes more important as you write more functions and begin to write your own packages.\nThis chapter concludes the programming section of the book. You’ve made a solid start on your journey to becoming not just a data scientist who uses R, but a data scientist who can program in R. We hope these chapters have sparked your interest in programming and that you’re looking forward to learning more outside of this book."

DNA is negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive pole. Many parameters can affect how the DNA moves through the gel: buffer composition, voltage, length of the gel, percentage of agarose in the gel (in other words, the density of the gel matrix), presence of salt in the DNA, protein bound to DNA, and other factors. Some of these conditions also affect which size ranges of DNA will effectively be “resolved” (i.e., separated enough from one another so you can see them as distinct fragment sizes). “Safeview” is a dye we use in the gel that fluoresces under UV or blue light when bound to DNA, allowing us to see and photograph it when viewed through a special orange filter to cut out the background light. The research goals of using electrophoresis might include:\n\nmeasuring the size of fragments in a DNA sample such as the products of PCR or assessing the intactness of the purified DNA from a tissue extraction\nseparating fragments from one another so that a particular amplicon or size range of DNA can be purified out of the gel for other downstream applications (such as for cloning a PCR fragment for making probes or for Sanger sequencing, or for size selecting a smear of fragments for making a RAD library) while excluding the other fragment sizes\nchecking for the presence or absence of a particular product of PCR as in a screen for orientation of a cloned fragment in a plasmid present in different bacterial colonies, a screen for an insertion in a transgenic animal, a screen to determine the genetic sex or the mitotype of a fish."

    "section": "Common Mistakes",
    "text": "Common Mistakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThese common mistakes will give you a big headache when trying to run gels\n\n\n\nBoiling over the agarose when making a gel.\n\nResult: failure to monitor the agarose when you are trying to dissolve it in the microwave can easily cause it to boil over because powdered substances create a lot of “nodes of nucleation” for bubbles to form. This is especially easy to accidentally do with higher percentages of agarose. It wastes expensive agarose and creates a mess in the microwave. What remains in the bottle will be of an indeterminate percentage/gel stiffness.\n\nNot making sure the tape is adhering well to the mold before casting a gel.\n\nResult: liquid agarose will leak out causing a mess and reagent waste. Make sure the mold is dry beforehand, and use the back edge of a comb, e.g., to run across the tape and make sure it has firm contact.\n\nPositioning the comb teeth too close to one side or to the bottom of the mold when setting up for pouring a gel.\n\nResult: the bottoms (or that side) of wells may be torn when the comb is pulled out, causing the loaded samples to leak out into the buffer during gel loading. Note: even when the comb teeth are not too close to the bottom, low percentage gels are soft and will benefit from having the comb pulled while submerged in the tank - otherwise the suction created by surface tension between the comb plastic and the agarose as you pull up on the comb can tear the bottoms out of the wells, causing loss of samples during loading.\n\nNot using the right % of agarose for your DNA size range of interest.\n\nResult: bands you care about won’t resolve optimally (i.e., you might not be able to accurately measure the sizes of your bands and might not be able to tell if something is one band or multiple bands). Pour a higher percentage gel to resolve large fragments (e.g. less than 1%) or a lower percentage gel (i.e. between 1 and 4%) to resolve small to very small ones, depending on your needs/expectations for what size bands you will see, how many of them, or how important it is to accurately estimate their sizes.\n\nNot homogeneously mixing the Safeview into the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: DNA might not be visible in all parts of the gel.\n\nOver-cooling the agarose before pouring.\n\nResult: Safeview will not be evenly distributed in the gel, and/or the gel have lumps and not be of uniform thickness because some of the agarose will have already started polymerizing.\n\nRunning a gel with a lot of bubbles in it.\n\nResult: DNA migration can be impeded/distorted by bubbles in the gel. Usually as a gel is cooling, bubbles will migrate to the top where (usually) they will be out of the path of the DNA unless the DNA volume fills the wells to the top. But bubbles can sometimes occur deeper in the gel – particularly in a very high % agarose gel. Try to nudge bubbles out of the way before the gel solidifies, either by raking them with a comb that is not on a holder or nudging individual bubbles with a pipette tip before the gel congeals. If the gel is already solid, avoid loading in lanes that will run across a bubble.\n\nRunning a gel that wasn’t mixed homogeneously before pouring in the mold.\n\nResult: there will be lumps in the gel of more dense agarose that will cause distortion of how the DNA migrates.\n\nAccidentally contacting the agarose with a pipette tip.\n\nResult: the bottom or side of the well can become perforated, causing the sample to leak out the bottom or into the next well. If the tip is pressed against the agarose, the sample can be forcefully and suddenly expelled and blast out of the well.\n\nOverloading the wells with too much sample volume.\n\nResult: samples can become cross-contaminated by DNA from adjacent wells.\n\nOverloading the lane with too much DNA.\n\nResult: DNA can become retarded during running and the apparent size will not be accurately gauged by the ladder.\n\nForgetting to load a DNA ladder.\n\nResult: you won’t know if your DNA bands are the right size when you look at and photograph your gel.\n\nNot using gel loading mix in the DNA or using ladder that isn’t premixed with gel loading mix.\n\nResult: The DNA or ladder (which is also DNA) will be lost mostly during loading without the gel loading mix that makes it sink to the bottom of the wells in the gel and stay there while you are loading. Both your samples and the ladder are DNA in an aqueous solution that is about the same density as the buffer (usually) – therefore they both should have gel loading mix in them in order to be denser than the tank buffer. The gel loading mix also includes convenient, charged dyes that migrate at different rates to help you see that your gel is running and how far it has progressed. The gel loading mix types only really matter if one type happens to have a dye that migrates exactly like your band of interest - in that case, you may want to switch to a different mix so that the dye doesn’t block the fluorescence of your band during visualization.\n\nNot thoroughly mixing gel loading mix into your DNA before loading.\n\nResult: you could lose part of your DNA to floating out of the well during loading. (This can also happen if there are other reasons your DNA is not very dense, such as if there is residual ethanol in it from preceding processing. In that case, you will see your DNA rapidly floating up to the surface as soon as you start expelling it from the tip).\n\nAdding premixed DNA ladder to your samples instead of gel loading mix.\n\nResult: ladder will appear in every lane, obscuring your bands and wasting expensive ladder.\n\nForgetting to start the current on your loaded gel.\n\nResult: DNA will diffuse both out of the wells and into the gel in all directions causing loss of some of the DNA and blurriness of the remaining DNA once the gel is run. Diffusion can also happen if it takes a long time to load the gel. If there are a great number of samples to load – such as in a two- or three-comb gel, it is often best to load one tier and run the gel for 5 minutes so the DNA enters the gel and diffuses more slowly before moving on to load the next tier. Diffusion can happen more quickly if the buffer is warm from a previous run. If the buffer is warm, replace it before trying to load another gel in the same box.\n\nNot keeping track of the order of sample loading.\n\nResult: you won’t know which lane corresponds to which sample. This can happen, for example, when loading samples from a strip of PCR tubes, where their order can accidentally be rotated 180 degrees, or when loading from a PCR plate, where the plate orientation can be rotated 180 or 90 degrees (e.g., wells are loaded with respect to rows versus columns).\n\nRunning your gel backwards by accidentally reversing the positive and negative electrodes.\n\nResult, your DNA will migrate out of the end of the gel nearest the wells (the “top” of the gel) and be lost into the tank buffer. Always check that your electrodes are hooked up to the correct leads relative to the terminals at the power source, that your gel is oriented so that the DNA will run toward the positive pole. If you have already loaded your gel in the wrong orientation, do not lift the gel out of the tank, but just reverse the leads (red to black) to correct the current. Remember that DNA is negatively charged and will run to the positive (red) pole. When you start the current, the negative electrode (anode) at the well end of the gel should be making noticeably more bubbles than the positive electrode (cathode) at the bottom end of the gel. That’s because electrolysis of water (H2O) will produce twice as much free hydrogen at the anode than the cathode makes free oxygen. Making a habit of checking that tells you two things: that current is really flowing and that you do have the right orientation of poles.\n\nRunning a gel at too low a voltage.\n\nResult: low molecular weight bands may look fuzzy and faint because they will be diffusing in random directions as they migrate.\n\nRunning DNA that is too salty - e.g., DNA in Phusion buffer or in NEB restriction buffer 3 (or 3.1) etc.\n\nResult: a “salt front” will form where DNA in those salty buffers will be slowed (“retarded”) relative to the ladder, making the ladder a useless measure of the actual size of the DNA. Bands will be compressed at a “front” and will be a weird shape like a smile or a frown rather than a straight band.\nIf you know your DNA is in a salty buffer, you can remove this problem by cleaning the DNA first (i.e., via a cleanup column or with paramagnetic beads), or you can mitigate the problem by diluting only a few microliters (e.g. 5 µl) of your DNA into water and gel loading mix before loading (assuming you have a high enough concentration of DNA that it can still be seen if you load only a small fraction of it).\n\nRunning a gel made up in a different buffer (or different concentration of buffer) than the buffer in the gel tank; this includes using old buffer that has been evaporating in the tank through multiple runs or over time.\n\nResult: bands will not migrate as expected. “Fronts” may form where the leading edge of the migrating DNA is compressed.\n\nLosing your gel of the end of the gel mold when you are taking it out of the tank.\n\nResult: the gel could shatter and be unsalvageable. Solution: transport gels in a dish and be especially careful when moving flabby, low percentage agarose gels (under 1%)."

Just leave the lid off when heating agarose.\n\nAdding Safeview to molten agarose that is too hot.\n\nResult: much of the Safeview will be degraded by heat, causing your DNA to be hard to see or image. The plastic gel mold could be permanently warped if the agarose is too hot. The tape may fail, causing a mess in the fume hood and reagent wastage. A swirled bottle should be just comfortable (70 degrees C or a bit less).\n\nRunning a gel at too high a voltage.\n\nResult: buffer could overheat during running and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box. Bands might look smear and not be well resolved.\n\nDissolving agarose in water instead of electrophoresis buffer or putting water in the electrophoresis tank instead of buffer.\n\nResult - total failure for DNA to migrate into the gel, loss of samples. If there is only water and not buffer in the tank, it could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box.\n\nOver-running your gel.\n\nResult: the DNA might run off the bottom of the gel and be lost. If you had more than one tier of wells in the gel, the DNA in the top tier will run into the zone of the next tier down, causing distortion and blurriness of the bands as they cross the wells of the lower tier and creating confusion in interpretation because very small fragments from the top tier will be overlapping very large fragments of the lower tier. If the gel runs for a long time, the buffer could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box."

Please think of your labmates when you are done running your gel.\n\n\nPlease really clean the gel molds and combs after use. The next person shouldn’t have to fish another lab mate’s combs and molds out of the sink and clean and dry them before they can pour their gel. After pulling combs from a polymerized gel, make sure to really rub them under a flow of water; a skin of polymerized agarose left on the combs (higher percentages of agarose are especially prone to this) will mean the next person has to clean this off before they can pour a gel. Likewise, make sure the gel melting bottle is rinsed immediately after you pour your gel. If residual agarose is allowed to dry in the bottle, it can create an almost insoluble blob in the gel of the next person to use the bottle. If you see that some of your agarose has polymerized in the bottle, add water to the bottle and microwave it for a few minutes to dissolve and discard the residue."
