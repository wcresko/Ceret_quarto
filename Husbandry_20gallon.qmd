-   **Sodium thiosulfate**: Make a 3% solution of sodium thiosulfate in a separate 2 gallon bucket. Add 5 L of water (to line) and 150g (marked on dispenser) of sodium thiosulfate. Mix

Note: When using bleach and/or sodium thiosulfate. Eye protection is required. Please use splash proof glasses or a face shield when using bleach and sodium thiosulfate.

## Procedure:

-   Complete bleaching and cleaning of tank. This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months.
-   Remove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced.
-   Drain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean air diffuser as instructed below.
    -   Clean the tank and all parts thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it.
    -   Squirt about 10 -- 20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand using a pad or sponge exposing all inside portions of the tank to bleach.
    -   Rinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it.
    -   Reassemble the tank and put it back on the rack. Fill with system water and allow water to recirculate for about 30 minutes before adding fish. Watch fish for 15min to look for any signs of distress.
    -   Using a dry erase marker record date/time on the front of the tank when system water is turned back on.
-   Initial the check list that you have completed the tank cleaning.

## Air difuser cleaning:

-   Remove dirty air diffusers from tanks and rinse with tap water to remove excess algae and debris.
-   Place in 10% bleach solution for 15-30 minutes.
-   Rinse the corner filters with hot water for 5 and then place into 3% sodium thiosulfate for 5 minutes.
-   Rinse with hot water for 5 minutes.
-   When cleaned air diffusers are placed back into aquaria, observe fish for 15 min for signs of distress.
