## Procedure

```         
  1.    Pour approximately 10-15 mL of 30% bleach solution into each tube containing bacterial waste. (More bleach solution is acceptable if there is a large amount of bacterial waste)
  2.    Let the bleach solution sit for 3-5 hours, or until the solution becomes clear again.
  3.    Pour the bleach and bacterial waste into the large carboy labeled ‘Bacterial Waste’ next to the North side sink.
  4.    Rinse the tubes with DI water and place them on the shelving units below the kitchen water bath
```

**Note - we should add how to deal with the bacterial carboy to this protocol.**
