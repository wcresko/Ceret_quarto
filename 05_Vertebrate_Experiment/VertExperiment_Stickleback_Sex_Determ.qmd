# Stickleback Sex Determination with PCR {#sec-vert_exp-SB_sex_PCR}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This protocol describes how to determine the genotypic sex of threespine stickleback with PCR.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vert Experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*),
-   **Author**: xxx
-   **Date Created**: xxx
-   **IACUC Approved**: Not applicable
-   **IBC Approved**: Not applicable

## Materials

-   2X turbo mix
-   GA1 F primer (10µM conc.)
-   GA1 R primer (10µM conc.)
-   Taq
-   npH~2~O
-   DNA

::: {.callout-notes title="NOTES"}
This procedure also works with GA2 and IDH primers although PCR parameters may be different.
:::

-   Extract DNA into 250µl final volume

### PCR recipe (1X)

| Reagent      | Concentration |  Volume  |
|--------------|---------------|:--------:|
| 2X turbo mix |               |   10µl   |
| GA1 F primer | 10µM          |  .25µl   |
| GA1 R primer | 10µM          |  .25µl   |
| Taq          |               |  .25µl   |
| npH~2~O      |               |  7.25µl  |
| DNA          |               |  2.0µl   |
| **TOTAL**    |               | **20µl** |

-   After all ingredients are added to a PCR tube put a 10µl drop of mineral oil on top.

### PCR reaction protocol

-   94˙C -- 5 minutes
-   94˙C -- 50 seconds
-   44˙C -- 50 seconds (44 cycles)
-   72˙C -- 1:20 minutes
-   72˙C -- 10 minutes

### Run PCR products on a 2% gel

::: {.callout-notes title="Banding patterns for males and femals on the gel"} 
The GA1F/R primer pair amplify a 371 bp band only in males, and they amplify a second, non-sex-linked 600 bp band in every fish. This second band acts as an internal control to help distinguish a female genotype from a failed PCR, when a 371 bp band is absent. Because of amplification efficiency differences, the 600 bp band will usually be significantly dimmer than the 371 bp band.
