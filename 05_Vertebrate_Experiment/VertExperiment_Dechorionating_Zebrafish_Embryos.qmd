# Dechorionating Zebrafish Embryos {#sec-vert_exp--zfish_dechorinate}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to dechorionate zebrafish embryos.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vertebrate experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Zebrafish (*Danio rerio*)
-   **Author**:
-   **Date Created**:

## Materials

-   Two pairs of Dumont #5 forceps
-   Fire-polished wide-bore Pasteur pipet
-   If using enzymatic dechorionation:
    -   6X flyfishing tippet
    -   Capillary tube
-   Microscope

## Solutions

-   E3 medium (quantities for 5 L of 60X stock listed after each ingredient in parentheses)
    -   5 mM NaCl (86 g)
    -   0.17 mM KCl (3.8 g)
    -   0.33 mM CaCl~2~ (14.5 g CaCl~2~ x 2H~2~O)
    -   0.333 mM MgSO~4~ (24.5 g MgSO~4~ x 7H~2~O)
    -   0.00001% (w/v) Methylene Blue (to be added to 1X solution)
-   2 mg/ml Pronase in E3 medium (Pronase Solution made from solid Powder (Roche 165921))

## Procedure

1.  Chorions can be removed easily using two forceps (it is critical that the tips are sharp and that their ends can touch). When raised in E3 medium at 28.5Â°C, zebrafish embryos develop normally outside of their chorions. Manually dechorionate embryos, using the following procedure:

    a.  While using one pair of forceps to hold the chorion, make a tear in the chorion with the other pair of forceps.
    b.  Hold the chorion in a region opposite of the tear, and gently push the embryo through the opening by passing the chorion and the embryo between the tips of the other pair of forceps.

Embryos younger than 15 hpf are particularly fragile and great care must be taken not to damage them.

2.  Alternatively, embryos can be enzymatically dechorionated in bulk using the following procedure:

    a.  Incubate the embryos in the Pronase Solution at room temperature for a brief time (typically 1-10 minutes, depending on the embryonic stage). Constantly check the condition of the chorions by gently depressing them with a poker (made by attaching a loop of 6X flyfishing tippet to a capillary tube) and looking at them under a microscope. When the chorions no longer return to a spherical shape, the Pronase treatment is complete.
    b.  Thoroughly wash the embryos (3 to 4 times) in E3 mediun to remove the Pronase solution. Using the fire-polished Pasteur pipet, pipet the embryos back and fourth in the E3 medium. The Pronase-treated chorions should break open, releasing the embryos.
    c.  Dechorionated embryos should be handled using fire-polished Pasteur pipets to minimize damage.
