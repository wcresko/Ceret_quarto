## Background

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their molecular size. During gel electrophoresis, an electrical field is used to help molecules travel through the pores of an agarose gel matrix. At one end of the gel, furthest away from where the samples are loaded, is a positive charge, and at the other end is a negative charge. Since DNA and RNA are both negatively charged molecules, they are pulled through the gel matrix towards the positive charge. Since proteins do not have a negative charge, researchers must first mix them with a sodium dodecyl sulfate detergent which gives them the negative charge needed to migrate towards the positive end of the gel. The speed at which molecules travel through the gel is inversely related to their molecular size. For example, small DNA molecules have a low molecular weight, enabling them to travel further through the gel matrix than a larger DNA molecule. When a gel is stained with DNA/RNA/protein-binding dye, these molecules can be seen as bands, whose location along the length of the gel represents the molecule?s size in terms of number of base pairs. When dye-stained DNA/RNA/protein is run beside a ladder with known fragment size, one can estimate the size of the assayed molecule. After the DNA/RNA/protein molecules have been separated using gel electrophoresis, the gel is imaged under UV light, visualizing the DNA/RNA/proteins present across the length of the gel.

## Procedure

::: {.callout-important title="This is important"}
Before beginning this procedure, read the section "Electrophoresis Tips" at the bottom of this procedure for more background information and to understand and anticipate the mistakes commonly associated with this protocol.
:::

1.  Weigh desired amount of Molecular Biology Grade Agarose - scale, weigh paper, and Agarose located on the common use bench on the north end of the laboratory - and pour it into the 500 ml Corning glass bottle labeled "Agarose Gels" (located on top of or inside the microwave on the south end of the laboratory).

    a.  1-1.2% Agarose (1 g-1.2 g) is a good starting amount of Agarose for DNA samples, though the amount of Agarose can vary depending on your particular samples and goals. The concentration of Agarose in a gel depends on the sizes of DNA fragments to be separated, with most gels ranging between 0.5%-2% Agarose.

2.  Fill bottle with 0.5X TBE buffer, located in the 20-liter Nalgene located at the south sink. The volume of TBE buffer used will be based on the size of the gel mold. For example, for a 14"x10" gel tray, use 100 ml of 0.5X TBE buffer. 3. Put bottle in microwave and microwave for one minute.

3.  Using the heat mittens located on top of the microwave, remove the bottle from the microwave, swirl the mixture around, and put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds. By the end of this step, the Agarose should be melted into the TBE and there should be no remaining solid Agarose particles.

4.  Using the heat mittens, remove the bottle from the microwave and carry it to the fume hood.

5.  Select a gel tray from the drawer under the gel boxes. Put tape around the two longest sides of the gel tray, pressing tape on firmly so it is air-tight with the tray. The distance between the top of the tape and the bottom of the tray should be at least half-an-inch tall so that it can hold all of the liquid from the Agarose Gel bottle without it spilling over the sides or leaking through any air gaps in the tape.

6.  Select a gel comb from the drawer under the gel boxes. Different combs make different sized wells that can hold different volumes, so select a comb based on your specific experiment. Place the gel comb in the notches of the gel tray. The combs should not touch the bottom of the tray but be slightly above it.

7.  Let the agarose solution cool for a few minutes. Using the heat mittens, swirl the Agarose Gel bottle again. Add 5 ul of Safe View (located in the Styrofoam box in the fume hood) to the Agarose Gel bottle. Gently swirl the bottle to mix in the Safe View; try to avoid creating bubbles while swirling.

8.  Slowly pour the Agarose Gel mixture into the gel tray with gel comb. Be careful not to create bubbles in the gel mixture while pouring. If there are bubbles, pop or move them to the bottom of the tray, away from the comb. Slowly lift the comb up and down a few times to ensure there are no bubbles around the comb.

9.  Let the gel mixture sit in the tray under the hood until it solidifies (usually takes around 20 minutes).

10. While you are waiting for the gel to solidify, clean the Agarose Gel bottle. Fill the bottle halfway with water, swirl the water, microwave for 30 seconds, swirl again and microwave for another 30 seconds. Pour out the water and set the bottle out to dry next to the microwave.

11. Once the agarose mixture has solidified, carefully remove the tape from the sides of the tray.

    ::: {.callout-important title="This is important"}
    Tape should be removed from the tray while held under the fume hood. Tape should be removed slowly to prevent any splattering of residual liquid on the top of the solidified gel.
    :::

12. Carefully remove the comb from the gel matrix by slowly pulling it straight up.

13. Carry the gel in the gel plate to the gel boxes, remove gel box lid, and slowly lower the gel and plate into gel boxes.

14. Load ladder of choice into the left-most well of the gel. The volume of ladder you load will vary depending on your experiment.

    ::: {.callout-important title="This is important"}
    When expelling the ladder into the well, only pipet to the first stop. Pipetting to the second stop risks expelling bubbles into the well which could interfere with the experiment.
    :::

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTES"}
    \*The ladder is made of DNA and needs a gel loading dye. When selecting a ladder to use, make sure that the ladder is not clear but has been mixed with a loading dye (should be a bright color like blue, orange, green, or purple).
    :::

15. Prepare DNA samples to be loaded into the wells of the gel. Pipet out 10 ul of DNA from each sample onto a piece of parafilm or into a PCR strip tube, using a fresh pipet tip for each sample to avoid cross contamination.

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTES"}
    \*The volume of DNA you mix load into each well depends on the concentration of DNA and how much of DNA of your total you can afford to use for the gel, though a generally good concentration range is 10-100 ng/ul to ensure the DNA can be visualized on the gel. If you are aiming to load a specific concentration of DNA into each well, calculate the concentration of your DNA sample and find that the corresponding volume is less than 10 ul, you can add the appropriate volume of EB Buffer to bring the sample's volume up to 10 ul.
    :::

16. Add 2 ul of 6X Loading Dye to each DNA sample. Thoroughly mix the dye and DNA sample by aspiration, but mix slowly to avoid creating bubbles. Be sure to use a fresh pipet tip in between DNA samples.

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTES"}
    \*The exact volume of loading dye you add to each sample can change depending on the amount of DNA you add, but the final dilution should be 1 part 6X Loading Dye to 5 parts DNA sample.
    :::

17. Load 10 ul of the DNA sample/dye mixture into the next available well in the gel.

    ::: {.callout-important title="This is important"}
    \*When expelling the DNA sample/dye mixture into the well, only pipet to the first stop. Pipetting to the second stop risks expelling bubbles into the well which could interfere with the experiment.
    :::

18. Put gel box cover on. Attach the electrodes to the metal posts at the top and bottom of gel box; the black electrode (-) attaches to the metal post on the top of the box and the red electrode (+) attaches to the metal post on the bottom of the box.

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTES"}
    Since DNA is a negatively charged molecule, it will run through the gel matrix towards a positive charge. A helpful way to remember electrode placement, then, is "Run to red," since the red electrode has a positive charge and should be placed furthest away from the DNA samples.
    :::

19. Turn on the Bio-Rad PowerPac and set it to your desired voltage. Press "Run." You can check to see if an electric current is running through the gel box by looking for a stream of small bubbles rising up the back of the gel box.

20. Run samples for desired time.

21. Press the "Stop" button on the Bio-Rad PowerPac and turn off the power. Remove the electrodes from either end of the gel box, loosely wind them up and place them above or next to the Bio-Rad PowerPac.

22. Remove the lid from the gel box. Carefully lift the gel tray out of the gel box, ensuring that the gel does not slide off the tray. Place the gel tray and gel onto the gel transferring tray (located behind the faucet on the south sink). Carry the gel to the gel imaging station (Azure Biosystems c200) in the Phillips Microfluidics Laboratory (Pacific 314).

23. To image the gel,

    a.  Open the door of the c200 Azure Biosystems gel imaging station, and carefully slide the gel inside. The long side of the gel should be facing the opening of the imaging station. Position the gel so that it is centered inside the imaging platform, and the short sides of the gel are parallel to the sides of the imaging platform. Close the door.
    b.  Select the "cSeries Capture Software" on the screen.
    c.  Select the "GEL" option in the top left corner, to the right of the "GALLERY" option.
    d.  Select the "BRIGHT BANDS" option in the bottom right corner.
    e.  Select "CAPTURE" to take an image of the gel.
    f.  Once your image has been captured, you may rotate, flip, crop, or zoom in/out of the image.
    g.  To print the image, select "PRINT" and choose the number of copies you would like to print.

24. Open the door of the c200 Azure Biosystems gel imaging station and carefully remove the gel. Wipe down the gel platform using a Kimwipe and close the door.

25. Carry your gel and printed images back to the lab. You may either dispose of your gel in the trash or store the gel in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for future use.

26. Rise off the gel transferring tray and set it to dry behind the south sink faucets. Rinse off the gel tray and the gel comb, ensuring that there is no remaining agarose between the tines of the gel comb. Set the comb and the tray to dry on the drying rack hanging above the south sink.

## Electrophoresis Tips

**Background**

The effect of electrophoresis is to separate DNA fragments by size in an agarose matrix and buffer using an electrical current. DNA is negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive pole. Many parameters can affect how the DNA moves through the gel: buffer composition, voltage, length of the gel, percentage of agarose in the gel (in other words, the density of the gel matrix), presence of salt in the DNA, protein bound to DNA, and other factors. Some of these conditions also affect which size ranges of DNA will effectively be "resolved" (i.e., separated enough from one another so you can see them as distinct fragment sizes). "Safeview" is a dye we use in the gel that fluoresces under UV or blue light when bound to DNA, allowing us to see and photograph it when viewed through a special orange filter to cut out the background light. The research goals of using electrophoresis might include:

-   measuring the size of fragments in a DNA sample such as the products of PCR or assessing the intactness of the purified DNA from a tissue extraction

-   separating fragments from one another so that a particular amplicon or size range of DNA can be purified out of the gel for other downstream applications (such as for cloning a PCR fragment for making probes or for Sanger sequencing, or for size selecting a smear of fragments for making a RAD library) while excluding the other fragment sizes

-   checking for the presence or absence of a particular product of PCR as in a screen for orientation of a cloned fragment in a plasmid present in different bacterial colonies, a screen for an insertion in a transgenic animal, a screen to determine the genetic sex or the mitotype of a fish.

**Common Mistakes**

-   Boiling over the agarose when making a gel. Result: failure to monitor the agarose when you are trying to dissolve it in the microwave can easily cause it to boil over because powdered substances create a lot of "nodes of nucleation" for bubbles to form. This is especially easy to accidentally do with higher percentages of agarose. It wastes expensive agarose and creates a mess in the microwave. What remains in the bottle will be of an indeterminate percentage/gel stiffness.

-   Not making sure the tape is adhering well to the mold before casting a gel. Result: liquid agarose will leak out causing a mess and reagent waste. Make sure the mold is dry beforehand, and use the back edge of a comb, e.g., to run across the tape and make sure it has firm contact.

-   Positioning the comb teeth too close to one side or to the bottom of the mold when setting up for pouring a gel. Result: the bottoms (or that side) of wells may be torn when the comb is pulled out, causing the loaded samples to leak out into the buffer during gel loading.

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTE"}
    Even when the comb teeth are not too close to the bottom, low percentage gels are soft and will benefit from having the comb pulled while submerged in the tank - otherwise the suction created by surface tension between the comb plastic and the agarose as you pull up on the comb can tear the bottoms out of the wells, causing loss of samples during loading.
    :::

-   Not using the right % of agarose for your DNA size range of interest. Result: bands you care about won't resolve optimally (i.e., you might not be able to accurately measure the sizes of your bands and might not be able to tell if something is one band or multiple bands). Pour a higher percentage gel to resolve large fragments (e.g. less than 1%) or a lower percentage gel (i.e. between 1 and 4%) to resolve small to very small ones, depending on your needs/expectations for what size bands you will see, how many of them, or how important it is to accurately estimate their sizes.

-   Not homogeneously mixing the Safeview into the agarose before pouring. Result: DNA might not be visible in all parts of the gel.

-   Over-cooling the agarose before pouring. Result: Safeview will not be evenly distributed in the gel, and/or the gel will have lumps and not be of uniform thickness because some of the agarose will have already started polymerizing.

-   Running a gel with a lot of bubbles in it. Result: DNA migration can be impeded/distorted by bubbles in the gel. Usually as a gel is cooling, bubbles will migrate to the top where (usually) they will be out of the path of the DNA unless the DNA volume fills the wells to the top. But bubbles can sometimes occur deeper in the gel -- particularly in a very high % agarose gel. Try to nudge bubbles out of the way before the gel solidifies, either by raking them with a comb that is not on a holder or nudging individual bubbles with a pipette tip before the gel congeals. If the gel is already solid, avoid loading in lanes that will run across a bubble.

-   Running a gel that wasn't mixed homogeneously before pouring in the mold. Result: there will be lumps in the gel of more dense agarose that will cause distortion of how the DNA migrates.

-   Accidentally contacting the agarose with a pipette tip. Result: the bottom or side of the well can become perforated, causing the sample to leak out the bottom or into the next well. If the tip is pressed against the agarose, the sample can be forcefully and suddenly expelled and blast out of the well.

-   Overloading the wells with too much sample volume. Result: samples can become cross-contaminated by DNA from adjacent wells.

-   Overloading the lane with too much DNA. Result: DNA can become retarded during running and the apparent size will not be accurately gauged by the ladder.

-   Forgetting to load a DNA ladder. Result: you won't know if your DNA bands are the right size when you look at and photograph your gel.

-   Not adjusting the amount of ladder for the comb width. Result: if you use a wider comb, you need to increase the amount of ladder or it will appear dimmer (because ladder DNA is more dilute across the span of the lane).

-   Not using gel loading mix in the DNA or using ladder that isn't premixed with gel loading mix. The DNA or ladder (which is also DNA) will be lost mostly during loading without the gel loading mix that makes it sink to the bottom of the wells in the gel and stay there while you are loading. Both your samples and the ladder are DNA in an aqueous solution that is about the same density as the buffer (usually) -- therefore they both should have gel loading mix in them in order to be denser than the tank buffer. The gel loading mix also includes convenient, charged dyes that migrate at different rates to help you see that your gel is running and how far it has progressed. The gel loading mix types only really matter if one type happens to have a dye that migrates exactly like your band of interest - in that case, you may want to switch to a different mix so that the dye doesn't block the fluorescence of your band during visualization.

-   Not thoroughly mixing gel loading mix into your DNA before loading. Result: you could lose part of your DNA to floating out of the well during loading. (This can also happen if there are other reasons your DNA is not very dense, such as if there is residual ethanol in it from preceding processing. In that case, you will see your DNA rapidly floating up to the surface as soon as you start expelling it from the tip).

-   Adding premixed DNA ladder to your samples instead of gel loading mix. Result: ladder will appear in every lane, obscuring your bands and wasting expensive ladder.

-   Forgetting to start the current on your loaded gel. Result: DNA will diffuse both out of the wells and into the gel in all directions causing loss of some of the DNA and blurriness of the remaining DNA once the gel is run. Diffusion can also happen if it takes a long time to load the gel. If there are a great number of samples to load -- such as in a two- or three-comb gel, it is often best to load one tier and run the gel for 5 minutes so the DNA enters the gel and diffuses more slowly before moving on to load the next tier. Diffusion can happen more quickly if the buffer is warm from a previous run. If the buffer is warm, replace it before trying to load another gel in the same box.

-   Not keeping track of the order of sample loading. Result: you won't know which lane corresponds to which sample. This can happen, for example, when loading samples from a strip of PCR tubes, where their order can accidentally be rotated 180 degrees, or when loading from a PCR plate, where the plate orientation can be rotated 180 or 90 degrees (e.g., wells are loaded with respect to rows versus columns).

-   Running your gel backwards by accidentally reversing the positive and negative electrodes. Result, your DNA will migrate out of the end of the gel nearest the wells (the "top" of the gel) and be lost into the tank buffer. Always check that your electrodes are hooked up to the correct leads relative to the terminals at the power source, that your gel is oriented so that the DNA will run toward the positive pole. If you have already loaded your gel in the wrong orientation, do not lift the gel out of the tank, but just reverse the leads (red to black) to correct the current. Remember that DNA is negatively charged and will run to the positive (red) pole. When you start the current, the negative electrode (anode) at the well end of the gel should be making noticeably more bubbles than the positive electrode (cathode) at the bottom end of the gel. That's because electrolysis of water (H2O) will produce twice as much free hydrogen at the anode than the cathode makes free oxygen. Making a habit of checking that tells you two things: that current is really flowing and that you do have the right orientation of poles.

-   Running a gel at too low a voltage. Result: low molecular weight bands may look fuzzy and faint because they will be diffusing in random directions as they migrate.

-   Running DNA that is too salty - e.g., DNA in Phusion buffer or in NEB restriction buffer 3 (or 3.1) etc. Result: a "salt front" will form where DNA in those salty buffers will be slowed ("retarded") relative to the ladder, making the ladder a useless measure of the actual size of the DNA. Bands will be compressed at a "front" and will be a weird shape like a smile or a frown rather than a straight band. If you know your DNA is in a salty buffer, you can remove this problem by cleaning the DNA first (i.e., via a cleanup column or with paramagnetic beads), or you can mitigate the problem by diluting only a few microliters (e.g. 5 µl) of your DNA into water and gel loading mix before loading (assuming you have a high enough concentration of DNA that it can still be seen if you load only a small fraction of it).

-   Running a gel made up in a different buffer (or different concentration of buffer) than the buffer in the gel tank; this includes using old buffer that has been evaporating in the tank through multiple runs or over time. Result: bands will not migrate as expected. "Fronts" may form where the leading edge of the migrating DNA is compressed.

-   Losing your gel off the end of the gel mold/gel sliding off the end of the gel mold when you are taking it out of the gel box. Result: the gel could shatter and be unsalvageable. Solution: transport gels in a dish and be especially careful when moving flabby, low percentage agarose gels (under 1%).

**Potentially Dangerous and/or Destructive Mistakes**

-   Heating a bottle with a lid on it. Result: possible explosion. Just leave the lid off when heating agarose.

-   Adding Safeview to molten agarose that is too hot. Result: much of the Safeview will be degraded by heat, causing your DNA to be hard to see or image. **The plastic gel mold could be permanently warped if the agarose is too hot**. The tape may fail, causing a mess in the fume hood and reagent wastage. A swirled bottle should be just comfortable (70°C or a bit less).

-   Running a gel at too high a voltage. Result: **buffer could overheat during running and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box**. Bands might look smear and not be well resolved.

-   Dissolving agarose in water instead of electrophoresis buffer or putting water in the electrophoresis tank instead of buffer. Result - total failure for DNA to migrate into the gel, loss of samples. **If there is only water and not buffer in the tank, it could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box.**

-   Over-running your gel. Result: the DNA might run off the bottom of the gel and be lost. If you had more than one tier of wells in the gel, the DNA in the top tier will run into the zone of the next tier down, causing distortion and blurriness of the bands as they cross the wells of the lower tier and creating confusion in interpretation because very small fragments from the top tier will be overlapping very large fragments of the lower tier. If the gel runs for a long time, the **buffer could overheat and permanently warp the plastic of the gel box.**

**Conscientiousness**

Please really clean the gel molds and combs after use. The next person shouldn't have to fish another lab mate's combs and molds out of the sink and clean and dry them before they can pour their gel. After pulling combs from a polymerized gel, make sure to really rub them under a flow of water; a skin of polymerized agarose left on the combs (higher percentages of agarose are especially prone to this) will mean the next person has to clean this off before they can pour a gel. Likewise, make sure the gel melting bottle is rinsed immediately after you pour your gel. If residual agarose is allowed to dry in the bottle, it can create an almost insoluble blob in the gel of the next person to use the bottle. If you see that some of your agarose has polymerized in the bottle, add water to the bottle and microwave it for a few minutes to dissolve and discard the residue.
