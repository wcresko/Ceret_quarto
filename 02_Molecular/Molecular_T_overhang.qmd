## Materials:

-   2.5 µl 10 X buffer
-   2.5 µl 1 mM dNTP mix
-   1 µl enzyme
-   5 µl 10x Klenow Exo- buffer (Epicentre)
-   1 µl dATP 10 mM
-   3 µl 5 u/µl Klenow Exo- (Epicentre)
-   5 µl 10x NEB buffer 2
-   0.5 µl rATP 100 mM
-   x µl of 10 µm\* T-overhang PE adapter
-   x µl water to 49.5 µl total
-   0.5 µl T4 DNA ligase (10 u/µl, Epicentre)
-   2.5 % agarose gel
-   QG
-   Qiagen gel extraction kit
-   MinElute columns
-   Zymo DNA column


## Procedure

### Shearing:

-   Up to 1 µg^†^ DNA in 100 microliters in EB (in 0.6 ml tubes, Axygen)
    -- fill all other positions in Bioruptor holder with tubes
    containing 100 µl water. Before beginning, make sure Bioruptor tank
    water is 4°C or less -- bail out and replace with chilled water if
    necessary and add a little crushed ice to the tank.
-   Set the controls to shear 30 sec. on, 30 sec. off for 15 cycles
-   After cycling, replace tank water with cold water and a little ice
-   Repeat shearing (i.e., another 15 cycles)
-   Zymo column concentrate -- elute 2 times with 10.5 µl EB.

::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
If you start with greater than 1 µg (up to 2 µg), you will either have
to scale up the volume of the ligation, decrease the amount of EB used
in the elution after addition of A overhangs, or make a batch of
annealed adapter that is greater than 10 µM in order to maintain a 10:1
ratio of adapter to fragmented DNA in the ligation reaction.

### End repair: {#end-repair .subhead}

To eluate, add NEB Quick Blunting kit reagents:

-   2.5 µl 10 X buffer
-   2.5 µl 1 mM dNTP mix
-   1 µl enzyme

Then:

-   30 min at room temperature
-   Clean with Zymo column, elute 2 times with 21 µl EB.

### Addition of A overhangs: {#addition-of-a-overhangs .subhead}

To eluate, add:

-   5 µl 10x Klenow Exo- buffer (Epicentre)
-   1 µl dATP 10 mM
-   3 µl 5 u/µl Klenow Exo- (Epicentre)

Then:

-   30 min at 37°C
-   Clean with Zymo column, elute 2 times with 20 µl EB

### Ligation: {#ligation .subhead}

To eluate, add:

-   5 µl 10x NEB buffer 2
-   0.5 µl rATP 100 mM
-   x µl of 10 µm\* T-overhang PE adapter
-   x µl water to 49.5 µl total
-   0.5 µl T4 DNA ligase (10 u/µl, Epicentre)
-   1 hour to overnight at RT

::: {.callout-warning title="NOTES"}
You should scale the adapter concentration to the amount of DNA used,
maintaining an approximate 10:1 molar ratio of adapter to fragments.
Assuming the average size of sheared fragments is 350 bp, 228 ng should
equal about 1 pmol. Starting with 1 µg, then, we'd have about 4.4 pmol.
10 times that would be 44 pmol of adapter or 4.4 µl of 10 µM adapter. In
reality, there is probably some loss of a percentage of cDNA during
cleanups, incomplete efficiency of blunting and A-overhang addition and
less than ideal shearing, all driving down the molarity of ligatable
fragments, so you can probably get away with adding less adapter than
calculated from the ideal. If you see a faint band of unincorporated
adapter in your size fractionation gel, that is probably a good
indication that you have saturated but not grossly exceeded the amount
of adapter needed.

## Alternatives

### Alternative A. 

- Zymo column purify, elute 2 times with 6 µl and
proceed to amplification before size fractionation. 
- Only do this if
there is a vanishingly small amount of material. It is probably better
to size-fractionate before amplification. 

### Alternative B. 

- Zymo column purify, elute 2 times with 10 µl and size fractionate (see below)
- Size fractionation: 2.5 % agarose gel Cut 200 -- 500, carefully avoiding
any unincorporated adaptor. 
- If desired, also cut 500-700 bp fraction.
- These two fractions should constitute most of the sheared cDNA. 
- The
smaller size range may be less biased against short transcripts. Recover
DNA with Qiagen gel extraction kit and MinElute columns. 
- Dissolve gel at
room temperature in 6 volumes QG. Follow manufacturer instructions,
being sure to let wash buffer stand on column for at least 5 min. before
spinning through. 
- Elute 2 times with 10 µl EB. Check concentration on Qubit fluorometer using Quant-It HS (high sensitivity) kit.
