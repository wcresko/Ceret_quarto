## Materials:

-   Alizarin red S
-   KOH
-   6% or 30% H~2~O~2~
-   NaOH
-   containers for solutions
-   shaker

## Solutions:

-   **0.5% Alizarin red S Stock**:
    -   To make 50 mls add 0.25g alizarin red S powder to 50 ml water.
-   **0.025% Alizarin Stain**
    -   To make 100 mls: Add 500Âµl 0.5% alizarin red S (stock) to 99.5ml 1% KOH
    -   1 Liter: Add 5ml 0.5% alizarin red S (stock) to 9950ml (1 liter) 1%KOH
-   **3% H202/0.5%KOH**: Mix and keep at 4C; Before using, bring to room temperature to hold down introducing bubbles under the skin: 0.5ml 6%H202 & 0.5ml 1%KOH.

Please use appropriate PPE when handling chemicals.

## Procedure:

1.  Fix in 4% PFA 2h to overnight depending on the size of the fish.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
We've found that adult fish should be fixed overnight.
:::

2.  Wash with 1% KoH 1 hour or longe on shaker.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
If found that a longer KoH wash results in better staining.
:::

3.  Bleach with 3% H202 : 1% KoH solution for 1-4 hours until the eyes and skin lose most of the pigment.

::: {.callout-note title="Warning"}
This step produces a gas. Do not put lids on containers while bleaching.
:::

4.  Wash with 1% KoH 2 hour on shaker.

5.  Stain with 0.025% Alizarin Red solution for 2 h or longer.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"} Check for the strenght of staining often. I prefer to slightly over stain as slight non-specific (muscles and etc) will clear in the following steps. ::

6.  Wash with 1% KoH 2 hour or longer on shaker depending on clearing of non-specific tissues.

7.  Store in 50% Isopropanol.
