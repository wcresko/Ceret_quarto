# TopoClone with PCR4 Vector {#sec-molecular-TopoClone_PCR4}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to TopoClone with PCR4 Vector.

-   **Procedure Type**: Molecular

-   **Author**: Susie Bassham

-   **Date Created**: xxx

## Materials

-   ice

-   bacterial plates

-   50 μl LB-Amp in round bottom plates

## Solutions

-   0.5 μl of salt solution
-   0.5 μl of vector
-   20 μl of TOP10 chemically competent cells
-   400 μl of room temp SOC
-   10.0 μl Lab PCR mix
-   0.25 μl T3/T7 Primer Pair
-   0.1 μl Taq
-   50 μl LB-Amp
-   14% Glycerol

## Procedure

1.  **TopoClone with PCR4 Vector**

    1.  Cut PCR bands from gels, freeze
    2.  Vortex band tubes, then spin at 14000RPM for 10min

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTE"}
    electrophoresis should be carried out in TAE buffer not TBE because the borate in TBE will interfere with ligation
    :::

    ::: {.callout-important title="NOTE"}
    if the PCR was carried out with an error correcting polymerase like Phusion, you will need to clean the reaction with beads or column and A-tail the products with dATP and wild-type Taq or with Klenow exo- before TA cloning.

    3.  1X cloning reaction
        1.  2 μl of supernatant from each tube
        2.  0.5 μl of salt solution
        3.  0.5 μl of vector
        4.  place at room temperature for 20min
        5.  add 20 μl of TOP10 chemically competent cells back on ice for 30 min 6 heat shock at42C for 30 sec
        6.  add 400 μl of room temp SOC, place at 37C for one hour
        7.  spread onto plates
        8.  incubate overnight at 37C

2.  **PCR Screen for Inserts**

    1.  Pick colonies from each plate with toothpick
    2.  Into 50 μl LB-Amp in round bottom plates, 37C for one hour
    3.  Use 2 μl as template for PCR reaction, put plate back at 37C

    1X PCR Reaction - 10.0 μl Lab PCR mix - 0.25 μl T3/T7 Primer Pair - 0.1 μl Taq

3.  **Overnight**

    1.  Use 2 μl to inoculate 5ml of LB-Amp, shake at 37C overnight
    2.  Qiagen miniprep next day, ready to sequence.

4.  **Storage of Clones**

    1.  Grow clone plates overnight at 37C
    2.  Next morning, add 50 μl LB-Amp, 14% Glycerol to each well (7% final)
    3.  Freeze for long term storage
